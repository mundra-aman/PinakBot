This brokerage sees gross refining margin falling 52 per cent YoY to $16 a barrel.
Consolidated sales for RIL is seen falling 4 per cent to Rs 2,09,771 crore compared with Rs 2,19,304 crore YoY.
For retail, Kotak sees Ebitda to grow 16 per cent YoY (3 per cent QoQ) on increased store footprint.
On YoY basis, it pegs RIL's Q1 consolidated profit at Rs 14,990 crore, down 17 per cent YoY.","['dividend', 'cent', 'sees', 'o2c', 'rs', 'consumerfacing', 'segments', 'crore', 'yoy', 'ebitda', 'growth', 'profit', 'drag', 'ril', 'results', 'consolidated', 'q1', 'quarter']","The June quarter results of Reliance Industries will likely be dragged by oil-to-chemical (O2C) segment, with its year-on-year (YoY) profit seen falling anywhere between 8 per cent and 17 per cent on a 2-8 per cent YoY drop in sales. Profit may fall even more on sequential basis, as weakness in O2C business may offset modest growth in telecom and retail segments, analysts said. All eyes would be on the management commentary on segments' performance and any clue on Jio Financial Services (JFS) listing, as while Piramal Pharma (45 days) and NMDC Steel (4 months) took some time to list post demerger, a few analysts see the JFS listing in a month's time.

Elara Securities expects RIL to report a 6 per cent YoY Ebitda growth, led by a 3 per cent Ebitda growth in retail and 12 per cent Ebitda growth in digital services (telecom), though partly offset by standalone Ebitda (primarily Q2C) decline of 15 per cent YoY. This brokerage sees gross refining margin falling 52 per cent YoY to $16 a barrel.

On sequential basis, ""RIL’s Ebitda would be negatively impacted by 9 per cent drop in O2C Ebitda (37 per cent contribution) due to lower gross refining margin and inventory losses. Retail/Jio businesses are expected to grow modestly 4 per cent/2 per cent QoQ while upstream business Ebitda is estimated to remain flattish. ARPU is expected to grow to Rs 180.60 from Rs 178.80 in Q1 FY23,"" Systematix Institutional Equities said in a note.

ARPU stands for average revenue per user.

As far as top and bottom lines go, Kotak Institutional Equities sees consolidated profit for RIL to fall 14 per cent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs 15,417.70 crore for the June quarter compared with Rs 17,955 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. Consolidated sales for RIL is seen falling 4 per cent to Rs 2,09,771 crore compared with Rs 2,19,304 crore YoY.

For RJio, this brokerage expects Ebitda to rise 15 per cent YoY (3 per cent QoQ) driven by 90 lakh overall net addition and a marginal increase in ARPU to Rs 181 from Rs 179 in the March quarter. For retail, Kotak sees Ebitda to grow 16 per cent YoY (3 per cent QoQ) on increased store footprint. In the case of O2C, Ebitda would likely decline 8 per cent, sequentially on auto fuel over-recoveries, Kotak said.

JM Financial is pegging profit figure for the oil-to-telecom major at Rs 15,764.90 crore, down 12.2 per cent YoY. It sees sales at Rs 2,13,471 crore, down 2.7 per cent YoY.

Nomura said it sees refining margins falling to $10 per barrel from $12 per barrel last quarter and lower export volumes, as RIL declared Force Majeure on exports from the Sikka port on account of the Biparjoy cyclone, which was partly offset by higher petchem spreads. On YoY basis, it pegs RIL's Q1 consolidated profit at Rs 14,990 crore, down 17 per cent YoY. It sees consolidated sales at Rs 2,01,530 crore, down 8 per cent YoY.

For the consumer-facing business, Nomura India sees Jio’s Ebitda to rise 3.5 per cent sequentially to Rs 12,600 crore driven by strong subscriber additions of 75 lakh and a modest increase in average revenue per user (ARPU) to Rs 181.50. It expects RIL’s retail segment Ebitda to see a 6 per cent sequential growth at Rs 5,000 crore, benefiting from the robust pace of store additions and rising footfalls.

""We estimate RIL’s 1QFY24F consolidated Ebitda to moderate 1 per cent sequentially to Rs 38,000 crore, as a healthy performance across both its consumer businesses and upstream will likely be offset by the O2C (Oil to Chemicals) business underpinned by lower refining margins,"" it said.

BofA Securities, on the other hand, sees consolidated profit at Rs 16,160 crore, down 10 per cent.

On a sequential basis, Prabhudas Lilladher said refining throughput may come in at 17 MTPA against 17.1 mt in March quarter. Petchem profitability will improve sequentially, due to demand recovery post China reopening. It expects Jio to show steady performance sequentially (2.9 per cent QoQ revenue growth and 1.5 per cent QoQ ARPU hike), while retail segment profitability should be resilient.

Reliance Industries, meanwhile, would also consider a proposal on dividend payment today.

The most cost-effective option is using the official government portal, which allows individuals to file their tax returns for free.

For those who prefer the convenience of private tax filing portals but wish to file their taxes independently, the charges typically range from Rs 200 to Rs 250. However, many individuals opt for expert assistance to ensure accurate filing and maximise deductions.

Amit Gupta, Managing Director at SAG Infotech, said, ""Using a private portal with tax expert assistance costs around Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,000. The complexity of compliance requirements may necessitate higher costs for individuals with foreign assets. Those with relatively straightforward foreign asset cases may pay around Rs 3,000 to Rs 4,000 for expert assistance, while individuals with more complex situations could incur Rs 4,500 to Rs 7,000 charges. Those with extensive foreign assets and intricate reporting requirements may need to pay between Rs 7,000 to Rs 10,000 for expert help. It is crucial to consider these costs and choose the appropriate option based on individual tax situations and requirements.""

It is crucial to file ITR correctly, otherwise, it may have several financial implications. Sundara Rajan TK, Partner, DVS Advisors, said, ""Though the assessee can file returns after the due date of July 31, the same comes with certain consequences. The most important of the same being that the losses, if any other loss from house property, shall not be allowed to be carried forward and set off in the subsequent years.""

The late filing fees would be either Rs 5000 or Rs 1000 until December 31, depending on income levels. Rajan said, ""Interest shall be levied at 1% p.m. till the date of filing of the returns. Beyond December 31, the assessee would have the option to file updated returns only in the case of if there is a tax payable, but an additional tax of 25% is to be paid for updated returns filed till March 31 of 2024 and 50% of additional tax after that till December 31, 2024.""

The assessing officer shall also have the option to initiate assessment under the best judgement method if returns are not filed or have been filed, not providing further details as requested by the assessing officer.

""Penalties up to 50% could be levied for underreporting income and up to 200% for misreporting of income. In the event of non-filing, the assessing officer shall have the option to issue notice for prosecution with imprisonment from 3 months to 7 years and a fine. Considering the financial impact of losses not being allowed to be carried forward, Interest and penalty coupled with the risk of prosecution in extreme cases, the assessees should strive to file the returns on time by taking advantage of the improved e-filing experience/resources,"" said Rajan.

Thus, if you face any difficulty filing your ITR, getting help from a chartered account is necessary."

Penalty: Late filing attracts a penalty of Rs 5000 for individuals with total income exceeding Rs 5 lakh.
Amit Gupta, Managing Director at SAG Infotech, said, ""The most immediate penalty for late filing is a late filing fee of Rs 5,000, depending on the length of the delay.
So, if you file ITR after December 31, 2023, you will have to pay a penalty of Rs 10,000.
Make it a priority to fulfil your tax obligations promptly and seek professional guidance whenever needed for a seamless and trouble-free tax filing experience.","['31', 'return', 'filing', 'late', 'rs', '202223', 'penalty', 'fy', 'file', 'happens', 'heres', 'tax', 'miss', 'itr', 'financial']","As someone well-versed in tax matters, I cannot stress enough the importance of filing your Income Tax Return (ITR) for the financial year 2022-23 before the deadline of July 31. Neglecting this obligation can result in the imposition of significant penalties and various adverse consequences.

An individual must file the tax return by the due date, for example, July 31, 2023, for Financial Year 2022-23. An option to file a belated return is available till December 31, 2023. Failure to file the tax return by the due date, July 31, 2023, will have financial implications.

1. Penalty: Late filing attracts a penalty of Rs 5000 for individuals with total income exceeding Rs 5 lakh. For individuals having a total income upto this limit, the penalty is Rs 1000. Amit Gupta, Managing Director at SAG Infotech, said, ""The most immediate penalty for late filing is a late filing fee of Rs 5,000, depending on the length of the delay. Furthermore, failing to complete your ITR on time may result in the loss of some tax deductions and exemptions. This could ultimately lead to higher tax liability."" So, if you file ITR after December 31, 2023, you will have to pay a penalty of Rs 10,000.

2. Interest for late filing: If taxes are due, failure to file the return by the due date will attract additional interest of 1% per month until the return is filed. Sundara Rajan TK, Partner, DVS Advisors, said, ""Interest shall be levied at 1% p.m. till the date of filing of the returns. Beyond 31st December, the assessee would have the option to file updated returns only in the case if there is a tax payable, but an additional tax of 25% is to be paid for updated returns filed till 31st March of 2024 and 50% of additional tax thereafter till 31st of December 2024.""

3. Prosecution: Penalties up to 50% could be levied for underreporting of income and upto 200% for misreporting of income. ""Non-filing of tax return despite the reminders may result in authorities initiating prosecution procedures with imprisonment ranging from three months to 7 years based on the tax outstanding,"" said Sudhakar Sethuraman, Partner, Deloitte India.

4. New regime benefit will not apply: Salaried employees cannot opt for the new tax regime, and if they opt for this with the employer, late filing will result in additional tax and interest.

5. Losses cannot be carried forward: Certain losses are available for carry forward to future years. Sethuraman said, ""This option is not available if returns are not filed on time. Only house property loss can be carried forward for future years.""

6. Delay in refund: Another potential downside of late filing is the possibility of delayed tax refunds, if applicable. Such delays can cause unnecessary financial strain and inconvenience. Additionally, late filers may attract attention from the tax authorities, increasing the likelihood of audits and inquiries into their tax affairs.

To avoid these unfavourable outcomes, it is crucial to promptly file your ITR and ensure compliance with all tax regulations before the deadline. If your tax situation is complex or uncertain, seeking professional advice is highly recommended. Tax experts can assist you in navigating through the process smoothly, ensuring you meet all legal requirements and maximize eligible tax benefits.

""As a responsible taxpayer, you must take the appropriate precautions to avoid these penalties and repercussions. If you anticipate having difficulty making the deadline, do not be afraid to seek professional assistance. Remember that completing your ITR on or before July 31 for FY 2022-23 is a financial duty that protects your interests and assures compliance with tax legislation,"" said Gupta.

Filing on time can avoid penalties, retain valuable deductions, and maintain good financial standing. Make it a priority to fulfil your tax obligations promptly and seek professional guidance whenever needed for a seamless and trouble-free tax filing experience.

If you have any outstanding tax liability, you will be charged punitive interest on the amount, as applicable in your circumstances, if you file a late return."

The stock fell 9.47 per cent to hit a low of Rs 1,311.60 on BSE. Infosys ADRs plunged 8.41 per cent to $16.22 apiece in overnight trading and were down another 0.7 per cent in the after hours. The steep fall in ADRs is reminding investors of a similar fall in Infosys ADRs in April following surprisingly weak March quarter results. That time, Infosys saw a double-digit percentage fall and was battered badly on the domestic market the next day.

A sudden sharp cut in revenue growth guidance in 1QFY24 is surprising for a company at the top of the game and leading growth charts, Kotak Institutional Equities said.

""This does warrant a closer scrutiny although there is nothing in metrics that suggests loss of competitiveness or wallet share. We cut FY2024-26E revenue forecast by 2-3 per cent and FY24 CC revenue growth forecast to 3.3 per cent from 4.9 per cent earlier. We cut EPS estimates by 2-3% baking in lower growth and marginal cut in margins, offset by change in INR/USD assumption,"" it said.

Nomura India said the IT firm is set to underperform industry growth in FY24F. It has downgraded the stock to 'Reduce' while suggesting a target of Rs 1,210 from 1,450.

""We lower FY24-25F earnings by 3-4 per cent driven by revenue estimates. Our revised EPS estimates are 5-6 per cent lower than the Street’s. We downgrade the stock to Reduce from Neutral, with a lower target price of Rs 1,210 set at an unchanged 18 times FY25F EPS. Our target multiple is based on a three-stage growth model discussed in our sector report and is lower than the five-year average of 20 times. The stock currently trades at 21.7 times FY25F EPS,"" the brokerage said.

Macquarie has downgraded the stock to 'Underperform' with a target of Rs 1,130. BofA Securities finds the stock Rs 1,390 worthy.

Manav Modi, Analyst, Commodity and Currency, MOFSL, said, “The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, touching the lowest level in two months amid labour market tightness and defying efforts by the U.S. Fed to slow demand. However, Philly fed manufacturing was reported lower than expectations capping some losses for the metal. The Fed is expected to raise rates by 25 basis points (bps) in a July 25-26 meeting next week, keeping them in the 5.25%-5.5% range until cuts are seen in 2024 onwards, per CME’s Fedwatch tool. UK consumer inflation data missed estimates on Wednesday, spurring bets that the Bank of England was close to ending its rate hike cycle. The reading followed similar declines in U.S. inflation seen last week, which ramped up bets that the Federal Reserve was also close to hitting peak interest rates for the year. Focus today will be on the UK retail sales data.”"

It’s quite common for NRIs to visit India for brief or prolonged stays for personal and professional commitments. Fortunately, the Indian health insurance market offers a wide range of products that cater to every segment, including the ones with pre-existing diseases or PEDs. Being diagnosed with diseases like Hypertension or Diabetes is increasingly becoming common across all age-groups and so, there are plans that can cover you right from Day 1 and come with no waiting period. Therefore, as an NRI, it will be more beneficial for you to obtain a health insurance plan covering pre-existing diseases (PED) from India in your situation. This will provide you with the necessary protection and support in managing your healthcare needs, providing peace of mind and financial security. It will also ease the financial burden by reducing the out-of-pocket expenses associated with ongoing treatments, medications, consultations, etc. Also, plans made in India are best suited to the needs of Indian policyholders so they make the cut for a good choice. Not to mention, they are far more affordable than plans bought abroad, especially developed countries.

Also, it would be best for you not to wait until you land in India. You can easily buy a plan from Australia by undergoing tele-medical check-ups, if needed and paying online. It is always recommended for people with PEDs to buy the plan as early as possible so that the claim process can be seamless if the need arises. These plans usually cost about 10-15 per cent more than the regular health insurance plans but are well-suited to those who need it. Apart from this, you should also opt for a high coverage plan with a sum insured of at least Rs 50 lakh to Rs 1 crore for adequate protection. This coverage will be crucial in protecting you against costly hospitalisation or day-care treatments, considering the possible complications related to high blood pressure if left unmanaged. It is also advised to go for a plan with minimum restrictions and more flexibility. So, look for aspects like room rent capping, co-pay or any other deductibles, and hospital network range to be sure. This will help in a convenient claim settlement without having to dip into your savings on out-of-pocket expenditure.

NRIs can also get tax benefits under Section 80D, just like Indian citizens if they file their returns in India. Additionally, they are also entitled to 18 per cent GST refund on tax. However, you need to bear in mind that the policy will be in force only in India so the coverage will be applicable only when you avail of treatment in India.

Pledging involves investors using their investment holdings, such as stocks, mutual funds, or other securities, as collateral to secure loans from financial institutions or lenders.

You have some investments in shares and mutual funds but don't want to redeem them now. You have checked with multiple avenues such as banks and fintech companies for a personal loan. The interest rate offered to you is very high. You wonder what other means could be to meet your cash requirement. The good part is, if you have shares and mutual funds but don't want to redeem them, there is an option for arranging emergency funds: Pledging.

Pledging involves investors using their investment holdings, such as stocks, mutual funds, or other securities, as collateral to secure loans from financial institutions or lenders. The collateralized assets provide lenders with a level of security, reducing their risk in case the borrower defaults on the loan. Unlike selling securities to raise funds, pledging allows investors to retain ownership of their assets. This ensures they can benefit from any potential future appreciation in the value of those assets.

Pledging often results in lower interest rates compared to conventional personal loans or credit card debt. The collateral acts as security for the lender, reducing the risk and, consequently, the interest rate. For example, while personal loans are offered in the range of 12-20 per cent, you can pledge your mutual fund units at 9-12 per cent.

Krishna Kanhaiya, Chief Executive Officer, Mirae Asset Financial Services (India) Pvt. Ltd explains how pledging works and dos and dont’s of pledging

What is the procedure for pledging mutual fund units?

Krishna Kanhaiya: In the case of the physical process that most of the players in the market follow, a pledge request form is submitted by the customer to the lender. The lender in turn submits it with the respective RTA (KFintech/ CAMS). The RTA creates the pledge and confirms it back to the customer as well as the lender.

The entire process takes 2-3 days. We at Mirae Asset follow digital lien marking through APIs and the entire process is done in a couple of minutes. The customer inputs OTP on our mobile app/ website to get into the respective RTA’s system. The customer can see the holding and choose the schemes and number of units he/ she wants to pledge and calculate the eligibility. After selecting the schemes and number of units the customer inputs one more OTP and the pledge is done.

1) How much is the loan-to-value ratio?

Krishna Kanhaiya: Loan to value ratio in the case of equity mutual funds is 45 per cent and in debt it is 80 per cent. For shares, LTV is 30 per cent to 45 per cent depending on the shares.

2) How much is the interest rate charged?

Krishna Kanhaiya: We charge 9 per cent p.a. interest on the utilised amount for the number of days the amount is utilised. For example, if someone creates a limit of Rs 1 lakh and utilises only Rs 50,000 and pays back the amount in 1 month, interest is charged only on Rs 50,000 for one month. Basically, 9 per cent p.a. interest is charged on the daily outstanding balance.

3) Can one prepay?

Krishna Kanhaiya: There is no EMI. The client can repay the amount anytime during the loan period which is one year. There is no prepayment penalty. The client can renew the loan after one year.



4) Can I pledge my mutual funds units for buying a house?

Krishna Kanhaiya: Yes, you can. There is no restriction.



5) What are the do's and don'ts?

Krishna Kanhaiya: Ideally, the loan against mutual funds/ shares should be used if you have long-term investments and short-term to medium-term money requirements. If you are holding investments in mutual funds for the short term, you should refrain from taking a loan against mutual funds to meet your medium-term to long-term money needs.

6) Can I claim a tax deduction if I am self-employed?

Krishna Kanhaiya: Yes, you can claim a tax deduction if you are a self-employed person provided you demonstrate to tax authorities that you have used the loan amount for the business. However, we suggest the clients take his/ her tax consultant’s opinion."
