CrowdStrike identified the hackers as ""Labyrinth Chollima"" - one of several groups alleged to operate on North Korea's behalf.
Mandiant said the hackers responsible worked for North Korea's Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB), its primary foreign intelligence agency.
The cybersecurity-focused podcast Risky Business earlier this week cited two sources as saying that North Korea was a suspect in the intrusion.
""I don't think this is the last we'll see of North Korean supply chain attacks this year,"" he said.","['tech', 'used', 'jumpcloud', 'korea', 'firm', 'koreas', 'mandiant', 'steal', 'korean', 'company', 'north', 'breached', 'cryptocurrency', 'hackers', 'crypto']","A North Korean government-backed hacking group penetrated an American IT management company and used it as a springboard to target cryptocurrency companies, the firm and cybersecurity experts said on Thursday.

The hackers broke into Louisville, Colorado-based JumpCloud in late June and used their access to the company’s systems to target ""fewer than 5"" of its clients, it said in a blog post.

JumpCloud did not identify the customers affected, but cybersecurity firms CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD.O) - which is assisting JumpCloud - and Alphabet-owned Mandiant (GOOGL.O) - which is assisting one of JumpCloud's clients - both said the hackers involved were known to focus on cryptocurrency theft.

Two people familiar with the matter confirmed that the JumpCloud clients targeted by the hackers were cryptocurrency companies.

The hack shows how North Korean cyber spies, once content with going after digital currency firms piecemeal, are now tackling companies that can give them broader access to multiple victims downstream - a tactic known as a ""supply chain attack.""

“North Korea in my opinion is really stepping up their game,” said Tom Hegel, who works for U.S. firm SentinelOne (S.N) and independently confirmed Mandiant and CrowdStrike's attribution.

Pyongyang's mission to the United Nations in New York did not respond to a request for comment. North Korea has previously denied organizing digital currency heists, despite voluminous evidence - including U.N. reports - to the contrary.

CrowdStrike identified the hackers as ""Labyrinth Chollima"" - one of several groups alleged to operate on North Korea's behalf. Mandiant said the hackers responsible worked for North Korea's Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB), its primary foreign intelligence agency.

The U.S. cyber watchdog agency CISA and the FBI declined to comment.

The hack on JumpCloud – whose products are used to help network administrators manage devices and servers – first surfaced publicly earlier this month when the firm emailed customers to say their credentials would be changed “out of an abundance of caution relating to an ongoing incident.”

In an earlier version of the blog post that acknowledged that the incident was a hack, JumpCloud traced the intrusion back to June 27. The cybersecurity-focused podcast Risky Business earlier this week cited two sources as saying that North Korea was a suspect in the intrusion.

Labyrinth Chollima is one of North Korea’s most prolific hacking groups and is said to be responsible for some of the isolated country’s most daring and disruptive cyber intrusions. Its theft of cryptocurrency has led to the loss of eye-watering sums: Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis said last year that North Korean-linked groups stole an estimated $1.7 billion worthof digital cash across multiple hacks.

CrowdStrike Senior Vice President for Intelligence Adam Meyers said Pyongyang's hacking squads should not be underestimated.

""I don't think this is the last we'll see of North Korean supply chain attacks this year,"" he said.

It added that the airline will have to comply with certain conditions.

This comes after the airline’s Resolution Professional Shailendra Ajmera recently invited Expressions of Interest (EoIs) from potential bidders.

DGCA said that it examined the resumption plan by Go First and the same has been accepted by them “subject to the outcomes of the writ petitions/applications” pending before the Delhi High Court and the (National Company Law Tribunal) NCLT.

It said that certain conditions must be met for the flight operations to commence.

Go First will be required to comply with all applicable regulatory requirements for holding an Air Operator Certificate at all times. It must ensure the continuation of the airworthiness or fitness of all its aircraft engaged in the operations.

The DGCA stated that none of Go First’s aircraft will be deployed for operations without undertaking a satisfactory handling flight. Any change in the company that has any bearing on the resumption plan submitted by the RP must be notified to DGCA.

“RP shall submit the proposed flight schedule, commensurate with the available resources in terms of airworthy aircraft, qualified pilots, cabin crew, AMEs, flight dispatchers etc., for the consideration ofDGCA after making requisite arrangements for commencement of scheduled flight operations, including the interim funding required for resumption of operations,” it said.

The regulator underscored that the scheduled flight operations can be commenced only after the availability of the required interim funding and approval of flight schedule by the DGCA. Once DGCA approves the flight schedule, Go First can commence the sale of tickets.

“The flight operations shall be subject to the proceedings and/or outcomes in the ongoing CIRP at NCLT, Delhi and other writ petitions/applications by the Lessors of aircraft leased to Go First, which are pending in the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi and NCLT, Delhi. RP shall submit information as sought by DGCA from time to time,” said the regulator.

The beleaguered airline had on Thursday announced that the Go First flights have been cancelled till July 23 due to operational reasons.

Earlier this month, Go First invited potential buyers or investors to express their interest through a court-appointed administrator, adhering to the procedural requirements mandated by Indian law. Go First filed for bankruptcy protection in May, blaming the grounding of almost half of its fleet of 54 Airbus A320neos to alleged issues with Pratt & Whitney engines. The engine manufacturer responded that the claims made by Go Airlines were unfounded and its misfortunes were of its own making.

The RIL stock went ex-date for demerger in the previous session. In a series of tweets, Kamath said the move might have helped in better price discovery and also ensured the buy average price was already adjusted on brokers' trading apps today.

""Ideally, companies should announce COA well in advance,"" he said while sharing a table that suggested the time taken by other organisations to report COA details.

The CEO of Zerodha said companies normally take time, even after ex-date to announce COA. ""Without this, trading apps can't adjust the buy average price for holdings downward to account for the demerger. This increases the risk of a retail investor panicking & exiting after seeing an artificial loss,"" he said.

He said it was good that RIL announced COA before the market opened yesterday, adding that if companies start doing this well in advance, brokers can adjust the price and show the accurate P&L to investors even on the ex-date. It helps investors stay invested by removing a reason to panic.

To recall, Reliance Industries’ press release, ahead of Thursday's session, gave a formula for determination of cost of acquisition of equity shares of RIL and Reliance Strategic Investments (to be renamed as JFS).

""""This communication is for the benefit of the shareholders and the company takes no express or implied liability in relation to this guidance,"" RIL said on Thursday.

Income Tax provisions states that the cost of acquisition in case of demerger will be net worth of the resulting company (RSIL or JFS) divided by the net worth of the demerged company (RIL). The formula stated apportion of de-merger cost of acquisition of equity shares of the RIL in the ratio of 4.68 for RSIL and 95.32 for RIL.

Centrum Broking said it used the standalone net worth of RIL of Rs 5 lakh crore and apportionment ratio of 4.68 per cent of RSIL to arrive at net worth of RSIL at Rs 23,500 crore.

It appears so.

Das recently said financial resilience is closely linked to a bank’s business model and strategy. The RBI has, therefore, started looking at banks’ business models more closely. “Aspects or deficiencies in the business model itself can spark a crisis in due course,” said Das, while speaking on ‘Future-Proofing the Indian Financial System’ at a conference organised by the College of Supervisors in Mumbai.

The RBI, as a lender of last resort, actually landed in a very uncomfortable situation when the two promising private sector banks—YES Bank and RBL Bank—were wobbling. In fact, YES Bank had to be rescued by a consortium led by the country’s largest bank, State Bank of India. In the case of RBL Bank, the RBI put its representative on the board, which also led to the hasty exit of MD and CEO Vishwavir Ahuja. The RBI was also blamed for not acting in time when the infrastructure financing institution IL&FS imploded, threatening the financial stability of the system.

In an address to bank shareholders, Uday Kotak said: “I feel the financial sector players risk becoming more robotic, curbing the entrepreneurial flair since the fear of making a mistake overrides the joy of creation and development. While we need ‘Arjuna’s eye’ on risk management, we must prevent bureaucratisation of financial services,” he said, while writing about the Indian economy being in a sweet spot and a good time for bold thinking.

Without going into specifics, Kotak said the policy and regulatory framework need to be aligned. “We must let entrepreneurship thrive, as I was fortunate to see in most of my career. There is a need to build regulatory trust, which requires action on both sides of the aisle,” he said.

The banking regulator, however, believes that a resilient, future-ready bank needs to be financially, operationally, and organisationally resilient. “To be financially resilient, a bank should have adequate capital buffers and be able to generate earnings even in times of severe macroeconomic shocks. It should also have adequate liquidity to meet its obligations in various situations,” said Das. In fact, the banks are leveraged institutions. The RBI is right, as the first priority of banks should be to protect the interests of depositors rather than take unwanted risks, says a private banker.

Concerns about financial stability cropped again up when a few US banks folded up because of asset-liability mismatches. There was no risk from the asset side (higher NPAs etc), but the mismatch in the assets and liabilities created a mess. “The recent events in the banking landscape of the US and Europe suggest that risks for an individual bank could crop up from segments of its balance sheet that might have been considered relatively safer,” said Das, while adding that the management and Board of Directors of each bank should continually assess the financial risks and focus on building up adequate capital and liquidity buffers even beyond the regulatory minimum for continued resilience and sustainable growth.

Business Today asked the RBI in a monetary policy conference about the likely risk emanating from the small finance banks (SFBs) as they offer higher deposit rates and deploy them in microloans, which are partly unsecured and also risky.

M K Jain, the deputy governor, who recently retired, said then that these SFBs were converted from NBFC MFI. “Earlier, there was a lot of concentration geographically as well as in the business. Now there is a road map for diversifying, and it cannot happen overnight. They require more time to diversify. They are on the right path. As far as raising the funds at a higher cost and offering a better NIM, we do track the business model of the SFBs. We also conduct stress testing, and whenever we find that risk has built up, we do advise the banks to take care of the risk build-up,” he said.

On the other hand, broader indices the BSE MidCap and BSE SmallCap gained 20 per cent and 21 per cent, respectively.

Data shows that LIC increased its holding in Tata Chemicals to 7.14 per cent in Q1FY24 from 4.13 per cent in the preceding quarter. Likewise, it held a 4.04 per cent stake in Indian Energy Exchange as of June 30, 2023, against 2.40 per cent on March 31, 2023.

In addition to this, LIC also significantly increased its stake in Gujarat Gas (to 3.22 per cent from 1.67 per cent), Atul Ltd (to 3.76 per cent from 2.32 per cent), Tech Mahindra (to 9.47 per cent from 8.07 per cent), Cipla (to 3.47 per cent from 2.15 per cent) and L&T Technology Services (to 5.70 per cent from 4.53 per cent).

Commenting on the information technology sector, Vinod TP, Research analyst Geojit Financial Services, said, “Indian IT companies are expected to rebound in the next couple of quarters with sustained margins and a growing order book size. The sector’s valuation has dropped significantly by over one-third, making it an attractive long-term investment option.”

LIC also had a 1.13 per cent and 1.09 per cent stake in SRF and DCB Bank, respectively, as of June 30. The insurance major was not among key shareholders in these two companies in the preceding quarter ended March 31.

While sharing its view on the chemicals sector, JM Financial in a report said, “World grain production for MY23/24 is likely to be close to a record high, and grain prices are still well above the 5-year average. Since the majority of the agrochemicals’ usage (above 40 per cent) is for grains, we don’t foresee an issue in demand for agrochemicals, specifically for the patented ones. A high crop price environment favours patented agrochemicals’ usage. This bodes well for PI, SRF, and Navin’s agrochemical businesses.”

In the IT space, LIC also bought an additional stake in Oracle Financial Services Software, Coforge and Mphasis. On the other hand, it further raised its stake in National Aluminium Company and Hindustan Zinc from the metal space.

Tata Power Company, Gail (India), IRCTC, Lupin, Marico, HPCL, UPL, Berger Paints, Deepak Nitrite, Bharat Dynamics, Bank of Maharashtra and Tata Consumer Products stood among other favourites in which LIC purchased additional shares.

Apple iPhone 15 series launch

As per the report, a global securities analyst at Bank of America, Wamsi Mohan, hints that the iPhone 15 series launch is likely to be pushed to the fourth quarter of the year. This means, Apple might host its iPhone launch event sometime between October and December. This comes after conducting channel checks in Apple’s supply chain. The analyst hasn't specified the exact reason for this delay.

Facing Issues with New Display

A new report by The Information reveals that Apple is facing issues with availability of displays of some iPhone models. It added that iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max models will be available in limited numbers at the launch. This delay is reported to be due to the problem with screen manufacturing at LG Display. These problems occurred because a new manufacturing process has been used to shrink the bezels size of the display. This is the same issue that happened with the Apple Watch 7 display that led to a delay of 1 month for the sales.

The iPhone 15 Pro model display is reportedly failing the reliability tests during a process in which it is fused with the metal shell. Apple is making the required changes in these displays, manufactured by LG, so that they can pass these tests.

It is because of these issues that the launch is likely to be delayed this year.

The report revealed that although there are issues with the displays, the launch will still take place on time in September. These are two different contradicting reports that have surfaced online recently.

Notably, Apple launched its iPhone 14 series on September 7 last year. However, iPhone 14 Plus debuted a month later, due to production disruptions caused by Chinese lockdowns at manufacturing sites.

Apple is expected to launch iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max this year.

“Most of the aircrafts in India are leased and domestic airlines had to go to the aircraft lessors abroad.

This is also in line with the intention of the Government to promote aircraft leasing business in the GIFT City,” he said.","['breather', 'units', 'tax', 'ifsc', 'city', 'gift', 'unit', 'leasing', 'business', 'exemption', 'engaged', 'tds', 'aircraft', 'dividend']","In a boost to the aircraft leasing business at GIFT City, the Union finance ministry has said the dividend paid by a unit in an International Financial Services Centre that engages in aircraft leasing business to another such unit in an IFSC will not be subject to tax deducted at source (TDS).

The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has notified these changes and also laid out conditions that these units will have to fulfil to avail the tax exemption. The notification comes into effect from September 1, 2023.

This follows the Union Budget 2023-24 where a clause was inserted in the Finance Act, 2023, to allow exemption in respect of dividend income earned by a unit in an IFSC engaged in the business of aircraft leasing provided the company paying dividend is also a unit in IFSC engaged in the business of aircraft leasing

Experts said the move will promote aircraft leasing business in the GIFT City as it brings tax parity with global hubs such as Dublin.

“Most of the aircrafts in India are leased and domestic airlines had to go to the aircraft lessors abroad. With the intent of providing an incentivised and quicker framework for the global players to establish in India, the aircraft leasing business was introduced in the IFSC with several incentives such as tax holiday, exemption of interest on loan payable by IFSC unit to a non-resident,” noted Amit Maheshwari, Tax Partner, AKM Global.

The distribution of profits in the form of dividends was also made tax free with effect from the fiscal 2023-24, and in line with this, the exemption of withholding tax on dividend has been brought, which will certainly give a relief to the lessors,” he further said.

Indian airline companies will also be able to lease aircrafts from GIFT following this change.

Sachin Garg, Partner, Nangia Andersen LLP said the government has now gone a step further by coming out with a notification laying down the modalities to allow the IFSC unit to pay dividend without tax deduction at source. “By allowing the payment to be made without TDS where the income is exempt in the hands of recipient makes an exemption truly effective as it removes the need to claim refund later. This is also in line with the intention of the Government to promote aircraft leasing business in the GIFT City,” he said.

The CBDT has also mandated that the recipient IFSC unit will need to submit declaration in Form No 1 to the payer of dividend that the said unit continues to be a unit working in IFSC and continues to be primarily engaged in the business of leasing of aircraft"

The cinema operator has also ensured a host of measures to bring patrons back to the cinema theatres.

According to a report in news agency Reuters, PVR Inox has set up countdown timers for the first time at several locations. It also rolled out Oppenheimer, starring Cillian Murphy, on Friday midnight, which is when it was released in the US.

The report stated that PVR has cut snack prices too and is offering unlimited popcorn refills on the weekends. For long cinemagoers have complained about the exorbitant pricing of popcorn and other snacks and beverages in the cinema halls.

Some theatres will also run an Oppenheimer movie marathon, meaning that there will be back-to-back shows over a 24-hour period, over the opening weekend.

PVR co-CEO Gautam Dutta told the news agency that the combined sales for Oppenheimer and Barbie movies for Friday to Sunday was 9 lakh tickets. This is the highest sale for any non-Marvel or non-Avatar movies.

Dutta expects ‘Barbenheimer’ to drive a notable portion of revenue for the current quarter.

Several Oppenheimer shows – including midnight and 7 am screenings on Friday – were fully booked.

According to BookMyShow, 8 per cent of those who bought Oppenheimer tickets also booked tickets for Barbie, starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling – many on the same day.

PVR’s hopes are pinned on Oppenheimer and Barbie as the overall box office collection in the first half of the year amounts to significantly lesser than last year’s. As per a recent report by Ormax Media, the cumulative box office for January-June releases stands at Rs 4,868 crore, which is 15 per cent lower than the same period in 2022.

The report estimates the box office collection of the year to wrap up at around Rs 9,736 crore, which would be 8 per cent lower than the annual collection of Rs 10,637 crore last year. However, the second half of the year has a good lineup, including Jawan, Salaar and Tiger 3.

The H1 2023 box collection was primarily driven by Shah Rukh Khan’s blockbuster hit Pathaan, that contributed 13 per cent of the overall earnings.

The agreement took place during Wickremesinghe's two-day visit to India.

""The agreement signed to launch UPI in Sri Lanka, will increase fintech connectivity,"" PM Modi said during a joint address with the Sri Lankan President.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe on Thursday kicked off a two-day visit to India. It is the first visit to India by a Sri Lankan leader since the island nation reeled under a severe economic crisis last year.

India extended financial assistance worth around USD 4 billion to Sri Lanka including lines of credit for purchases of food and fuel last year when it was hit by the economic crisis.

India and Sri Lanka will conduct feasibility studies on petroleum line, land bridge connectivity between the countries, PM Modi said on Friday, after holding talks with the Sri Lankan president in New Delhi.

This year is quite important for relations between India and Sri Lanka, he said. ""We (India-Sri Lanka) have decided to begin talks on economic and technological cooperation. We have also agreed to increase air connectivity between two countries,"" the Prime Minister said.

Just a few days back, India and France agreed to use UPI in the European nation. The move came during PM Modi’s two-day visit to Paris.

PM Modi, from atop the Eiffel Tower, said that Indian tourists will soon be able to make Rupee payments using UPI. He was addressing the Indian community at the La Seine Musicale, a performing arts centre on an island in River Seine.

""In France, an agreement has been made for the use of India's UPI...It will be started from the Eiffel Tower, and now Indian tourists would be able to make payments in Rupees, through UPI, in the Eiffel Tower,"" PM Modi said.

Prior to France, India had signed an agreement with Singapore’s PayNow in 2023 to allow users in both the countries to make cross-border transactions. Meanwhile, UAE, Bhutan, and Nepal already have adopted the UPI system.

Shares of SBI were trading 1.03 per cent higher at Rs 616.25 while those of Infosys were down 8.64 per cent at Rs 1,323.60. SBI last managed to get past Infosys in the m-cap race on May 17 this year.

""Soft and uncertain demand environment has led to pessimism on growth. Despite robust orderbook, actual transitioning to revenues seems obscure and is a headwind,"" said Elara Securities, which has a target of Rs 1,230 on the stock.

A sudden sharp cut in revenue growth guidance in 1QFY24 is surprising for a company at the top of the game and leading growth charts, Kotak Institutional Equities said.

We cut EPS estimates by 2-3 per cent baking in lower growth and marginal cut in margins, offset by change in INR/USD assumption,"" it said.

An average target price on SBI at Rs 718, on the other hand, suggests a 17 per cent potential upside ahead. Macquarie has downgraded the stock to 'Underperform' with a target of Rs 1,130.

Infosys revised downward its FY24 CC revenue guidance to 1-3.5 per cent compared with 4-7 per cent suggested earlier. It maintained its Ebit margin guidance at 20-22 per cent. While a few brokerages did anticipate some downward revision in revenue guidance, a 1-3.5 per cent growth target missed their forecasts by a wide margin.

Shah, who had stints in GE Capital and Bain & Company, took charge at Mahindra in 2021 after joining the group in 2014.
This share, Shah declares, should only go up from here on.
Besides, there’s the Born Electric range of SUVs where Mahindra aims to be the leader “by far”.
Besides, the recent GST Council decision on a compensation cess on all multi-utility vehicles is another blow Mahindra will have to navigate.","['revving', 'mahindra', 'automakers', 'sector', 'slew', 'strategy', 'brand', 'shah', 'suvs', 'growth', 'propel', 'share', 'vehicles', 'theres', 'group', 'auto']","An outside-in perspective very often yields good results as far as strategic changes in an organisation are concerned. In the case of the Rs 1.75-lakh crore auto-to-software Mahindra Group, this came in the form of Group MD & CEO Anish Shah, 53. Shah, who had stints in GE Capital and Bain & Company, took charge at Mahindra in 2021 after joining the group in 2014. One of the key areas where Shah has been able to make an impact is in the auto business, a critical part of the group and one that contributes close to Rs 60,000 crore to its top line. Over the past couple of years, Mahindra has seen its auto business get infused with a good dose of new energy, powered by a slew of new launches, a focus on electric vehicles and even a brand new logo.

Shah and his colleague Rajesh Jejurikar, ED & CEO of Mahindra’s auto and farm sector businesses, are clear that they will do fewer things but do them well. “We focussed on our core, that is authentic SUVs, with the aim of being the No. 1 SUV player,” Shah tells Prerna Lidhoo, who put together the cover story and the Auto Special package in this issue. This sharp focus seems to be working for Mahindra. Its market share in SUVs, which was at 13.6 per cent in FY21, has grown to 19.1 per cent in just two years. This share, Shah declares, should only go up from here on. Besides, there’s the Born Electric range of SUVs where Mahindra aims to be the leader “by far”. But competition is hardly sitting idle, with Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors, Hyundai, Kia and Toyota planning their moves as the UV battle heats up like never before, with utility vehicles now overtaking passenger car sales in the Indian market. Besides, the recent GST Council decision on a compensation cess on all multi-utility vehicles is another blow Mahindra will have to navigate.

Mahindra apart, the auto package also has several other stories: Chetan Bhutani examines the impact of the paring of the FAME II subsidy scheme on EV sales, while Arnab Dutta finds out how Chinese automakers MG Motor and BYD are tackling the government’s close watch on investments from China. We also get you the details of the battle playing out in the premium motorcycles segment, as Royal Enfield is challenged by the likes of Bajaj Auto (which has tied up with Triumph) and Hero MotoCorp, the Indian partner for Harley-Davidson.

Away from the heat and dust in the auto sector, Anand Adhikari does a deep dive into the slew of problems plaguing the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, once hailed as the big reform sweeping through the corporate and banking sectors. And Krishna Gopalan gets you the behind the-scenes action at Reliance Life Sciences, which could become Mukesh Ambani’s next big bet. I would also urge you to read Rahul Kanwal’s conversation with Ruchir Sharma, the Founder of Breakout Capital, who holds forth on the economy, the PLI scheme, AI and much more.

The movie, which tells the story of physicist Robert Oppenheimer and the development of nuclear weapons during World War II, serves as a stark 'warning' to the world.
Nolan, best known for directing films like ""Memento,"" ""Dunkirk,"" and the Batman trilogy, emphasizes that the conflict faced by technology today is not very different to that of what Oppenheimer faced.
According to a report by AFP, Nolan said, ""Artificial intelligence researchers refer to the present moment as an 'Oppenheimer moment'.""
While some argue that nuclear weapons have brought stability to the world, Nolan, personally, finds this notion far from reassuring.","['ai', 'moment', 'nolan', 'nuclear', 'easy', 'cautionary', 'silicon', 'world', 'weapons', 'tale', 'christopher', 'oppenheimer', 'war', 'faced', 'valley', 'offers']","In his latest film 'Oppenheimer,' renowned director Christopher Nolan delivers a powerful cautionary tale, drawing parallels between the invention of the atomic bomb and the current challenges posed by artificial intelligence (AI). The movie, which tells the story of physicist Robert Oppenheimer and the development of nuclear weapons during World War II, serves as a stark 'warning' to the world.

Nolan, best known for directing films like ""Memento,"" ""Dunkirk,"" and the Batman trilogy, emphasizes that the conflict faced by technology today is not very different to that of what Oppenheimer faced. The physicist's work at the Los Alamos Laboratory resulted in a groundbreaking scientific achievement. But at what cost?

According to a report by AFP, Nolan said, ""Artificial intelligence researchers refer to the present moment as an 'Oppenheimer moment'."" He further added, ""look at his story for some guidance as to what is their responsibility - as to what they should be doing.""

Similar to how scientists feared nuclear fission would trigger a catastrophic chain reaction during the atomic tests, AI researchers now grapple with concerns that their creations could escape their control, endangering humanity. Nolan made the statements to AFP in Paris while promoting his film.

No Easy Answers

However, Nolan admits that there are no easy answers to the ethical dilemmas posed by technological advancements. The movie portrays the moral dilemmas faced by the scientists working on the Manhattan Project, who, despite wanting to end World War II, were grappling with the responsibility of creating destructive weapons.

Nolan said, ""But I don't think it offers any easy answers. It is a cautionary tale. It shows the dangers. The emergence of new technologies is quite often accompanied by a sense of dread about where that might lead.""

While some argue that nuclear weapons have brought stability to the world, Nolan, personally, finds this notion far from reassuring. The recent war in Ukraine has reignited concerns about nuclear disasters and tensions between superpowers not seen since the Cold War.

Cillian Murphy on AI

Even the protagonist of Oppenheimer, Cillian Murphy, who portrays the haunted scientist in the film, expressed the gravity of the present moment, describing it as a significant moment in history. The actor said, ""That was a moment in history. This is one too."""

Unlike Twitter, Threads lets you sign in with your Instagram account.
On the contrary, Threads allows you to share 10 items in a single post.
Threads allows users to restrict other accounts on the platform.
Lastly, there’s no edit option on Threads, something Twitter users dreaded for years to get and finally got as part of the premium subscription.","['mark', 'thing', 'twitter', 'key', 'users', 'musks', 'instagram', 'vs', 'differences', 'account', 'trending', 'offers', 'allows', 'limit', 'zuckerbergs', 'elon', 'wins', 'threads']","While Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg’s possible cage fight is still in talks, round 1 of the battle has already begun virtually. Instagram head Adam Mosseri recently introduced a Twitter rival app called Threads. It is now available for all iOS and Android users globally.

Since Twitter pioneered this space, Zuckerberg mostly derived inspiration from Twitter in his app while making a few tweaks here and there. However, Threads needs polishing to convince users to switch from Twitter.

Twitter VS Threads: Top key differences

One of the biggest flexes that Threads has is the easy sign-in process. Unlike Twitter, Threads lets you sign in with your Instagram account. You will be able to follow the same people from Instagram and more and you do not have to manually add details like username, bio or display picture. This is one of the major steps that saves a lot of time and trouble.

Another thing that Threads offers better than Twitter is the character limit. Threads has a 500-character limit on posts while Twitter offers 280-character limit. Twitter has a limit of four items including website links, videos and images per tweet. On the contrary, Threads allows you to share 10 items in a single post.

Another major highlight is that Threads does not have ads at all. However, they will be introduced in future. Instagram CEO says that will happen when Threads will have 1 billion users. Threads allows users to restrict other accounts on the platform. When you restrict an account, you will not receive any notifications from that particular account and that account holder will not be able to reply, comment, repost or quote your post. This is not exactly like blocking anyone or unfollowing, it is somewhere between that. Twitter, on the other hand, allows users to mute an account or block them altogether.

In terms of pricing, Threads is absolutely free of cost, just like Instagram, while Twitter charges up to Rs 799 per month for its Twitter Blue service to give access to premium features.

While Threads has a lot of things going for it, it is still new. Hence, it is a bit rough on the edges. Surprisingly, you cannot send direct messages to other users on Threads. To do that, you will have to go back to Instagram.

Another thing is that Threads doesn’t have hashtags. Twitter has a thriving trending section where users can sift through various trending topics across genres and regions easily but there isn’t a specific trending section on Threads, you can only see a more random selection of Threads from across users.

Lastly, there’s no edit option on Threads, something Twitter users dreaded for years to get and finally got as part of the premium subscription.

Threads witnessed a great response from users all around the world and attracted 5 million users in just 4 hours of being launched. Threads’ biggest user base is India which accounts for 33 per cent of the global downloads of the app.

Soon after the release of the film, Twitter users took to the platform to share their views on the film, with many of them even calling it Dhawan's best film to date. While some said that the film is unconvincing and fails to impress.

Film trade analyst Sumit Kadel, for instance, said, the film would have done really well, had it been released in cinemas. ""Have to say this loud and clear that its very disheartening to see that @Varun_dvn career best film #Bawaal has a direct OTT release.

Oppenheimer, based on Pulitzer Prize-winning biography called 'American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J Robert Oppenheimer', revolves around the life and accomplishments of J Robert Oppenheimer, portrayed by Cillian Murphy.

J Robert Oppenheimer is famously known as the physicist who spearheaded the Manhattan Project, a pivotal endeavor during World War II to develop an atomic bomb. The film also features Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, among others.

Soon after the two Hollywood titles released across theatres, movie goers were quick to share their reactions on the films.

Oppenheimer Twitter review:

Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is being received very well by audiences across the globe, with many even terming it his ""best movie to date"".

""#Oppenheimer was monumental. Christopher Nolan's best movie to date, with soaring score by Ludwig Goransson and impeccable cast of Hollywood faces (led by Cillian Murphy and surely an Oscar take by RDJ). 'Epic' undersells it. It is essential viewing that leaves you in silence,"" a user wrote.

On the other hand, Greta Gerwig's Barbie has also opened up to good reviews from cine lovers. While some called the film insightful and creative, others recommended it's a must-watch.

""#Barbie is a fantastic film. A very strong message about uniqueness, self love and acceptance. I was laughing the entire time and then I found myself moved by the incredibly powerful (yet subtle) real meaning of the movie. Greta Gerwig is a mastermind,"" a Twitter user wrote.

Another said, it's a movie ""you'll be rewatching again and again and you'll never get tired"".

Adani, who heads the Adani Group, met with Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe to discuss the proposed venture, in addition to the development of a container terminal and a 500 MW wind project, reported PTI.

In a tweet, Adani described it as a ""great honour"" to meet with President Wickremesinghe and discussed a range of fascinating projects in Sri Lanka.

""Great Honour to have met H.E.

The Adani Group is already engaged in significant projects in Sri Lanka. Notably, Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ) is working on a $700 million container terminal at the Colombo Port, which is a crucial transhipment hub in South Asia.

Furthermore, the conglomerate's renewable energy arm, Adani Green Energy, is investing $500 million to set up two wind projects of 286 MW in Mannar and 234 MW in Pooneryn, slated for completion by December 2024.

Sri Lankan Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekara on Monday said that the renewable energy project to generate 500 MW in Sri Lanka's north and eastern regions undertaken by India's Adani Group will be completed by December next year.

The introduction of a green hydrogen project marks the latest development in the group's endeavours. Green hydrogen is considered a cleaner alternative to conventional hydrogen, as it is produced by splitting water using renewable energy, emitting only water vapour when it burns.

As details regarding the green hydrogen project are yet to be revealed, industry stakeholders and environmental enthusiasts are closely watching the development.

To boost the economic partnership between the two nations, India and Sri Lanka adopted a vision document that would strengthen people-to-people connectivity and maritime cooperation, trade, and power, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on Friday. ""Today, we have adopted a vision document for our economic partnership. The vision is to strengthen maritime, air, energy and people-to-people connectivity between the two peoples. The vision is to accelerate mutual cooperation in tourism, electricity, business, higher education, and skill development,"" PM Modi said.

In a joint press statement along with Sri Lanka President Ranil Wickremesinghe in New Delhi on Friday, PM Modi also said that the two nations have decided to start a ferry service from Tamil Nadu to Sri Lanka. ""We agree on the enhancement of air connectivity between India and Sri Lanka. To increase trade and travel by people, we have taken the decision to start passenger ferry services between Nagapattinam in Tamil Nadu and Kankesanturai in Sri Lanka,"" PM Modi said.

The two sides decided on resuming passenger ferry services between Nagapattinam in India and Kankesanthurai in Sri Lanka and work towards early resumption of ferry services between Rameshwaram and Talaimannar, and other mutually agreed places. ""This vision is the long-term commitment of India. We would soon hold a consultation on economic cooperation, Prime Minister Modi added.

Moreover, the two sides also exchanged a joint declaration of intent on Animal husbandry. India and Sri Lanka also exchanged MoU on Renewables, Economic development of projects in Trincomalee district and UPI usage.

""Polygon continues to strengthen further. On the TradFi front, the US Federal Reserve has launched a long-awaited FedNow service which will be similar to India’s UPI. The Fed has also confirmed after releasing this service that it is not related to a ""digital currency,"" he added.

Top crypto tokens were trading mixed on Friday, with a positive bias. Among the gainers, Polkadot surged about 8 per cent, while Toncoin gained about 4 per cent. Dogecoin and Polygon were down 2 per cent each. On the downside, XRP plunged 5 per cent, followed by a 4 per cent fall in Solana and Cardano each.

The global cryptocurrency market cap was trading flat and it continued to hold at $1.21 trillion-mark as it declined marginally, less than a per cent, in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes dropped more than 6 per cent to $30.87 billion.

Bitcoin's dominance is close to its 1-month low, as investors are shifting their focus to smaller, riskier tokens. One such token is XRP, which has surpassed Bitcoin in trading volume after a court ruling determined that it is not a security, said CoinDCX Research Team.

Tech View by Giottus Crypto Platform

Ethereum (ETH) is in a adescending trend and bearish momentum with the asset trading above its 50-day exponential moving average. ETH is consolidating between the range of $1,880 and $1,950, where it faces immediate resistance. If the price successfully surpasses this, it could lead the asset towards next resistance at $2,000.

Also, the 14-day RSI (at 51) indicates a neutral sentiment. These values suggest that the consolidation may continue in the near term if ETH holds the $1,875 support level. On the down side, if ETH fails to hold the $1,850 support level, it could encounter renewed selling pressure.

Major Levels:

Support: $1,875, $1,850

Resistance: $1,950, $2,000"

In an interview with Tanya Aneja of BTTV, Parminder Chopra, Chairman and Managing Director (CMD) of Power Finance Corporation (PFC), talks about the firm’s plans. Edited excerpts:

BT: What kind of returns can investors expect from PFC NCD?

PC: This is a public issue of bonds, so we thought of bringing it in three tenders. It is an investment opportunity for 3 years, 10 years and 15 years. The interest rates are in the 7.45%-7.50% range for 3 years. For 10 years, it is 7.53%, and for 15 years the coupon rate is 7.55%. So, our focus is on retail, we have allocated the proceeds 40% each for HNIs and retail.

For institutional investors and non-institutional investors like corporations, the interest rates and coupons are slightly lower. For three years it is 7.45%. For 10 years it is 7.47% and for 15 years it is at 7.50% and the allocation for both categories is 10% each.

The minimum investment is Rs 10,000 and further in multiples of Rs 1000 each. So, as you rightly said it is a base issue of is Rs5,000 crore with an option for the issue up to Rs4,500 and these will be secured, redeemable rated and taxable bonds will be listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

BT: How is the loan mix evolving and how much of the loan book would be towards government and private lending as of now?

PC: PFC 31st March 2023 PFC has a loan book of approximately Rs4.22 Lakh crore. If you talk of the bifurcation between the government and the private sector, 83% outstanding is from the government sector and 17% is from the private sector. Talking about the loan 12% of the loan book is renewable and 42% is from conventional generation.

BT: If you talk about asset quality, the stressed assets have reduced significantly over the past few years. But how is the asset quality trend expected to pan out in FY 24?

PC: Yeah, you rightly said that it has improved a lot from, even if I talk in absolute numbers from Rs 30,000 Crore. It's just now Rs 15,000 crore and with a sufficient cushioning of approximately 72%. The stressed assets NPA ratio is only 1.07%. I would like to share with you that in the past year, we have not added any new NPA and going forward also, we are expecting our loan book to remain OK.

BT: PFC is looking to diversify its loan book and, you know, venture into funding road infrastructure projects. So can you tell us about that?

PC: PFC has been framed primarily to fund the power sector only. So traditionally, we have been funding the power sector. We are looking for funding for the ports, airports, metros, refineries, and roads.

BT: what is your outlook as far as power sector is concerned?

PC: The power sector is maturing day by day. There were issues at one point in time, related to the capacity generation capacity in the power sector. We are happy to share that we are able to meet the peak load demand successfully. Transmission issues have also been resolved over a period of time. But definitely with the expansion of the power sector, there will be an additional requirement for the transmission system in the dis distribution sector was the one which is the last leg in the power sector and on the other hand, has a direct interface with the consumers and is quite sensitive if we talk of the public welfare.

So a lot of work is being done for improvement in the infra sector. And a lot of schemes have been introduced by the government of India to make the overall sector viable. So if we are able to succeed in this, then definitely viability of the whole sector will be much better as compared to earlier times for this government of India scheme of revamped the distribution scheme that is going to be the milestone and will lead to a turnaround of the sector.

BT: What kind of business growth are you expecting going ahead?

PC: If we talk about FY 24 last year PFC’s loan book has grown by 13%. So there was a lull period for two years. Because of covid, the construction work was not much. The groundwork was not picking up. So disbursements stopped at that point in time, But we hope that now the scenario is much better. A lot of work is going on and we hope to improve."

It’s quite common for NRIs to visit India for brief or prolonged stays for personal and professional commitments. Fortunately, the Indian health insurance market offers a wide range of products that cater to every segment, including the ones with pre-existing diseases or PEDs. Being diagnosed with diseases like Hypertension or Diabetes is increasingly becoming common across all age-groups and so, there are plans that can cover you right from Day 1 and come with no waiting period. Therefore, as an NRI, it will be more beneficial for you to obtain a health insurance plan covering pre-existing diseases (PED) from India in your situation. This will provide you with the necessary protection and support in managing your healthcare needs, providing peace of mind and financial security. It will also ease the financial burden by reducing the out-of-pocket expenses associated with ongoing treatments, medications, consultations, etc. Also, plans made in India are best suited to the needs of Indian policyholders so they make the cut for a good choice. Not to mention, they are far more affordable than plans bought abroad, especially developed countries.

Also, it would be best for you not to wait until you land in India. You can easily buy a plan from Australia by undergoing tele-medical check-ups, if needed and paying online. It is always recommended for people with PEDs to buy the plan as early as possible so that the claim process can be seamless if the need arises. These plans usually cost about 10-15 per cent more than the regular health insurance plans but are well-suited to those who need it. Apart from this, you should also opt for a high coverage plan with a sum insured of at least Rs 50 lakh to Rs 1 crore for adequate protection. This coverage will be crucial in protecting you against costly hospitalisation or day-care treatments, considering the possible complications related to high blood pressure if left unmanaged. It is also advised to go for a plan with minimum restrictions and more flexibility. So, look for aspects like room rent capping, co-pay or any other deductibles, and hospital network range to be sure. This will help in a convenient claim settlement without having to dip into your savings on out-of-pocket expenditure.

NRIs can also get tax benefits under Section 80D, just like Indian citizens if they file their returns in India. Additionally, they are also entitled to 18 per cent GST refund on tax. However, you need to bear in mind that the policy will be in force only in India so the coverage will be applicable only when you avail of treatment in India.

You have some investments in shares and mutual funds but don't want to redeem them now. You have checked with multiple avenues such as banks and fintech companies for a personal loan. The interest rate offered to you is very high. You wonder what other means could be to meet your cash requirement. The good part is, if you have shares and mutual funds but don't want to redeem them, there is an option for arranging emergency funds: Pledging.

Pledging involves investors using their investment holdings, such as stocks, mutual funds, or other securities, as collateral to secure loans from financial institutions or lenders. The collateralized assets provide lenders with a level of security, reducing their risk in case the borrower defaults on the loan. Unlike selling securities to raise funds, pledging allows investors to retain ownership of their assets. This ensures they can benefit from any potential future appreciation in the value of those assets.

Pledging often results in lower interest rates compared to conventional personal loans or credit card debt. The collateral acts as security for the lender, reducing the risk and, consequently, the interest rate. For example, while personal loans are offered in the range of 12-20 per cent, you can pledge your mutual fund units at 9-12 per cent.

Krishna Kanhaiya, Chief Executive Officer, Mirae Asset Financial Services (India) Pvt. Ltd explains how pledging works and dos and dont’s of pledging

What is the procedure for pledging mutual fund units?

Krishna Kanhaiya: In the case of the physical process that most of the players in the market follow, a pledge request form is submitted by the customer to the lender. The lender in turn submits it with the respective RTA (KFintech/ CAMS). The RTA creates the pledge and confirms it back to the customer as well as the lender.

The entire process takes 2-3 days. We at Mirae Asset follow digital lien marking through APIs and the entire process is done in a couple of minutes. The customer inputs OTP on our mobile app/ website to get into the respective RTA’s system. The customer can see the holding and choose the schemes and number of units he/ she wants to pledge and calculate the eligibility. After selecting the schemes and number of units the customer inputs one more OTP and the pledge is done.

1) How much is the loan-to-value ratio?

Krishna Kanhaiya: Loan to value ratio in the case of equity mutual funds is 45 per cent and in debt it is 80 per cent. For shares, LTV is 30 per cent to 45 per cent depending on the shares.

2) How much is the interest rate charged?

Krishna Kanhaiya: We charge 9 per cent p.a. interest on the utilised amount for the number of days the amount is utilised. For example, if someone creates a limit of Rs 1 lakh and utilises only Rs 50,000 and pays back the amount in 1 month, interest is charged only on Rs 50,000 for one month. Basically, 9 per cent p.a. interest is charged on the daily outstanding balance.

3) Can one prepay?

Krishna Kanhaiya: There is no EMI. The client can repay the amount anytime during the loan period which is one year. There is no prepayment penalty. The client can renew the loan after one year.



4) Can I pledge my mutual funds units for buying a house?

Krishna Kanhaiya: Yes, you can. There is no restriction.



5) What are the do's and don'ts?

Krishna Kanhaiya: Ideally, the loan against mutual funds/ shares should be used if you have long-term investments and short-term to medium-term money requirements. If you are holding investments in mutual funds for the short term, you should refrain from taking a loan against mutual funds to meet your medium-term to long-term money needs.

6) Can I claim a tax deduction if I am self-employed?

Krishna Kanhaiya: Yes, you can claim a tax deduction if you are a self-employed person provided you demonstrate to tax authorities that you have used the loan amount for the business. However, we suggest the clients take his/ her tax consultant’s opinion."

Back in 2019 in Tamarac, near Fort Lauderdale, Florida, the young girl, only 4 years old, experienced an incident where a Chicken McNugget from her Happy Meal fell on her leg, resulting in a scar. The incident occurred while they were in their car at a McDonald's drive-thru.

The family had initially sought $15 million in damages, claiming that the McNugget was ""dangerously hot"" and caused harm to the minor.

The Florida jury granted Olivia compensation based on the pain, suffering, and emotional distress she endured due to the incident. The awarded amount totalled $800,000, with $400,000 covering the past four years and an additional $400,000 for future damages.

The jury reached this decision after the family's legal team presented evidence, including photographs of the burn and an audio recording of Olivia's screams at the moment the McNugget fell on her leg.

In their defence, McDonald's argued that the appropriate compensation should be $156,000, claiming that Olivia's pain ended once the burn healed within three weeks. The outlet's lawyer also pointed out that Olivia continued to visit McDonald's and consume chicken nuggets despite the incident.

The mother of the young girl, Olivia, referred to the legal decision as a ""momentous"" event and expressed her contentment to the US media after the court proceedings saying she was “just happy.” She mentioned that she had no specific expectations regarding the outcome but found the awarded compensation to be fair.

Regarding Olivia's burn injury and the resulting scar, the mother revealed that Olivia was willing to undergo a procedure to have the scar removed."

U.S. prosecutors have called Bankman-Fried the mastermind of a fraud that led to FTX's collapse, and included the misappropriation of billions of dollars of customer funds.

Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty to several criminal charges. Ellison, Wang and Singh have pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.

According to Thursday's complaint, the fraudulent transfers included more than $725 million of equity that FTX and West Realm Shires, an entity that Bankman-Fried controlled, awarded ""without receiving any value in exchange.""

FTX said Bankman-Fried and Wang also misappropriated $546 million to buy shares of Robinhood Markets (HOOD.O), while Ellison used $28.8 million to pay herself bonuses.

It also said some of Bankman-Fried's criminal defense is being funded from a $10 million ""gift"" he gave his father.

""The transfers were made when (FTX-related entities) were insolvent, and defendants knew it,"" FTX said.

Federal law lets bankruptcy trustees avoid transfers of property made in the two years before Chapter 11 filings, if the transfers are made for less than their value and with an intent to defraud a bankruptcy estate.

The case is FTX Trading Ltd et al v Bankman-Fried et al, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware, No. 23-ap-50448. The main bankruptcy case is In re FTX Trading Ltd et al in the same court, No. 22-bk-11068."
