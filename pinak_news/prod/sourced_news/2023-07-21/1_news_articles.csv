The Ministry also added that a time limit of 2-3 years is generally kept for the completion of new NH projects.

Yet the list doesn’t end here. While many consumers may be aware of the redressal mechanism, there are many more who usually end up filing a police complaint or take to vandalism. The real issue sometimes, these complaints are not valid yet often an angry mob leads to destruction. “While the three-tier system has been given the green light, there remains a dearth of awareness among the consumers. Most of the complaints have been resolved by tier-1 but it is important to create some mechanism to find whether these complaints are valid or not,” Nitin Gupta, chief content officer, Chaupal OTT, a multi-regional OTT platform, said.

Interestingly, the majority of industry experts have highlighted the need to re-evaluate the definitions of objectionable content such as half-truths, indecency, causing annoyance, among others Part III of the IT Rules, 2021, to preserve online free speech and promote creative freedom, as per recently released joint study by The Dialogue and IAMAI titled ‘IT Rules: A Regulatory Impact Assessment Study. Moreover, it also stressed the need for greater emphasis on ensuring the optimum use of grievance redressal mechanisms by the users. Furthermore, the report suggested that nine out of 10 content creators, directors and producers highlighted that petty complaints requesting a ban and injunction on creative works under different forums and criminal sanctions impact their ease of doing business. “Over the last decade, India’s content regulation space has progressed rapidly and the IT Rules, 2021, marked a significant milestone in the Platform Regulation ecosystem. The ongoing deliberations for the new IT Act provide an important opportunity to address new aspects through greater research and multi-stakeholder dialogues which will ensure that our policies continue to remain rights-enabling as well as innovation-friendly,” Kazim Rizvi, founding director, The Dialogue, said.

What is wrong?

Premium video-on-demand (VOD) is growing engagement in India, according to a recent report by Media Partners Asia. Total consumption across the online video sector reached 6.1 trillion minutes for the 15-month period from January 2022 to March 2023. Within this, the premium VOD category had a 12% share when compared to 10% in 2021 with YouTube and remaining dominant with an 88% share. MPA in its report stated that the 12% number compares well with other emerging markets that is Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines where the norm for premium VOD share is below 10% but trails more developed markets such as Australia at 35%. Interestingly, India is not too far behind markets such as Japan and Korea where the norm is 15-20%.

To be sure Disney+ Hotstar led premium VOD category consumption over CY 2022 versus Q1, 2023 with a category viewership with 38% share over the measured 2022-Q1 2023 period. This was driven by sports as well as the depth of its Hindi and regional entertainment.

As per industry stakeholders as and when guidelines will be revisited there is a need to create well-defined targeted principle-based regulation. What this means is that as broad definitions of prohibited content open avenues for subjective interpretations

and enforcement which can stifle civil rights and creative freedom, hence there is a need to create a structure. Secondly, it is important that the government, platforms and civil society work collaboratively to raise awareness and empower the users. Add to that, multiple complaints against multiple producers and OCC platforms for hurting religious and national sentiments. As per the report, the frequent instances of criminal complaints against directors and producers and demand for injunctions are an unreasonable restriction of their creative freedom and economic rights. Experts argue that a ban or injunction would directly result in the violation of Article 19. “A lot of time and effort goes into making the content. Platforms take precautions keeping in mind the sensitivities of the audience,” Gupta, added.

Looking back

Content on over-the-top (OTT) platforms has always gained traction, from day one. And the pandemic just fueled this growth. With the increasing diversity in content, regulations too caught up. The Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 introduced a three-tier grievance redressal mechanism, including a government body at its third tier, attempting to regulate a previously unregulated sector. “There were regulations for TV and theatres but as the internet evolved and as these apps proliferated, they invoked regulations. There were extensions of different laws from different acts like the Information Technology Act and even from the Indian Penal Code applicable to the platforms for violation of any associated law,” Rakesh Maheshwari, former senior director and group coordinator, cyber laws and data governance, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY).

The online curated content (OCC) platforms, a subset of OTT platforms, have been requested to categorise content based on five age categories – – U (Universal), U/A 7+, U/A 13+, U/A 16+ and A (Adult). As per the code of conduct, platforms are required to implement parental locks for content classified as U/A 13+ or higher and a reliable age verification mechanism for content classified as A. “We segregate the content according to the code of conduct. The content is marketed while keeping in mind the age segregation. The platforms have lower complaints owing to the three-tier grievance redressal mechanisms compared to social media,” Soumya Vilekar, co-founder and CFO, Planet Marathi, a Marathi OTT platform, said.

It is a subset of the Nifty 50 index, representing the top 50 companies listed on India's National Stock Exchange (NSE). The Nifty IT index comprises the top 10 IT companies listed on the NSE, based on their market capitalisation. These companies are among the largest IT services and software providers in India, and some of them are also global players in their respective domains.

The Nifty IT index is a market capitalization-weighted index, which means that the weightage of each company in the index is proportional to its market capitalization. This implies that the performance of larger companies has a greater impact on the index than smaller companies. The Nifty IT index is an important benchmark for investors interested in investing in the IT sector in India. It provides a broad view of the performance of the IT industry, which is a key sector of the Indian economy. The index is also a reference point for index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the IT sector in India.

The performance of the Nifty IT index is influenced by various factors, including the global trends in the IT industry, the demand for IT services and software, and the performance of individual companies. The index tends to be volatile, as it is sensitive to news and developments in the IT sector. For instance, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 had a significant impact on the IT industry, as many companies had to switch to remote work and adapt to new ways of working. As a result, the Nifty IT index experienced significant fluctuations during the pandemic.

It records the market performance of the Indian banks giving investors and market intermediaries a benchmark so they can evaluate properly before investing. The index constitutes a maximum of 12 companies listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and is computed through the free float market capitalization method. Investors or companies can use the Nifty Bank index for numerous purposes like benchmarking fund portfolios and launching index funds, ETFs and structured products. Though it was launched on September 15, 2003, Nifty Bank’s base value on the base date i.e, January 01, 2000, was set at 1000 and has given a CAGR of 24.61% in the first 10 years.

What are the eligibility criteria for the selection of constituent stocks under Nifty Bank?

At the time of review, companies should be a part of NIFTY 500. If the number of eligible stocks falls below 10, then according to NSE, the deficit number of stocks should be selected from the available stocks ranked within the top 800 based on daily average turnover and daily average full market capitalisation based on the data of previous six months which is used for index rebalancing of NIFTY 500. The company should be a part of the banking sector and its trading frequency needs to be at least 90% in the past six months. A listing history of six months is necessary for the company but if it comes out with an initial public offer (IPO) then it can be included in the index if it fulfils the eligibility criteria for three months instead of six. Only those companies can be a part of the index which are allowed to trade in the F&O segment. The final selection of all 12 companies is done based on the free-float market capitalization methodology by calculating the weightage of each company in the index in such a way that no stock weighs more than 33% and the top 3 stocks cumulatively should not be more than 62% during rebalancing. The index rebalancing is done on a semi-annual basis.

Who manages the Bank Nifty Index?

A professional team manages all the indices of NSE and follows a three-tier governance structure which includes the board of directors of NSE Indices Ltd, Index Advisory Committee (Equity) and the Index Maintenance Sub-Committee.

What is the Bank Nifty futures & options contract?

A forward contract trading on an exchange is called a futures contract. The Bank Nifty futures contracts are based on the Bank Nifty index. According to NSE, the maturity date of the contract, the underlying index and a market lot are some characteristics of the futures contract. These contracts are available for trading from the intro to the expiry date. Bank Nifty futures have a maximum of 3-month trading cycle - the near month (one), the next month (two) and the far month (three). A new contract is introduced on the trading day following the expiry of the near-month contract. The contracts expire on the last Thursday of the expiry month. If it is a trading holiday on the last Thursday, then contracts expire on the previous trading day."

Interestingly, India is not too far behind markets such as Japan and Korea where the norm is 15-20%.

To be sure Disney+ Hotstar led premium VOD category consumption over CY 2022 versus Q1, 2023 with a category viewership with 38% share over the measured 2022-Q1 2023 period. This was driven by sports as well as the depth of its Hindi and regional entertainment.

As per industry stakeholders as and when guidelines will be revisited there is a need to create well-defined targeted principle-based regulation. What this means is that as broad definitions of prohibited content open avenues for subjective interpretations

and enforcement which can stifle civil rights and creative freedom, hence there is a need to create a structure. Secondly, it is important that the government, platforms and civil society work collaboratively to raise awareness and empower the users. Add to that, multiple complaints against multiple producers and OCC platforms for hurting religious and national sentiments. As per the report, the frequent instances of criminal complaints against directors and producers and demand for injunctions are an unreasonable restriction of their creative freedom and economic rights. Experts argue that a ban or injunction would directly result in the violation of Article 19. “A lot of time and effort goes into making the content. Platforms take precautions keeping in mind the sensitivities of the audience,” Gupta, added.

Looking back

Content on over-the-top (OTT) platforms has always gained traction, from day one. And the pandemic just fueled this growth. With the increasing diversity in content, regulations too caught up. The Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 introduced a three-tier grievance redressal mechanism, including a government body at its third tier, attempting to regulate a previously unregulated sector. “There were regulations for TV and theatres but as the internet evolved and as these apps proliferated, they invoked regulations. There were extensions of different laws from different acts like the Information Technology Act and even from the Indian Penal Code applicable to the platforms for violation of any associated law,” Rakesh Maheshwari, former senior director and group coordinator, cyber laws and data governance, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY).

The online curated content (OCC) platforms, a subset of OTT platforms, have been requested to categorise content based on five age categories – – U (Universal), U/A 7+, U/A 13+, U/A 16+ and A (Adult). As per the code of conduct, platforms are required to implement parental locks for content classified as U/A 13+ or higher and a reliable age verification mechanism for content classified as A. “We segregate the content according to the code of conduct. The content is marketed while keeping in mind the age segregation. The platforms have lower complaints owing to the three-tier grievance redressal mechanisms compared to social media,” Soumya Vilekar, co-founder and CFO, Planet Marathi, a Marathi OTT platform, said.

It is a subset of the Nifty 50 index, representing the top 50 companies listed on India's National Stock Exchange (NSE). The Nifty IT index comprises the top 10 IT companies listed on the NSE, based on their market capitalisation. These companies are among the largest IT services and software providers in India, and some of them are also global players in their respective domains.

The Nifty IT index is a market capitalization-weighted index, which means that the weightage of each company in the index is proportional to its market capitalization. This implies that the performance of larger companies has a greater impact on the index than smaller companies. The Nifty IT index is an important benchmark for investors interested in investing in the IT sector in India. It provides a broad view of the performance of the IT industry, which is a key sector of the Indian economy. The index is also a reference point for index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the IT sector in India.

The performance of the Nifty IT index is influenced by various factors, including the global trends in the IT industry, the demand for IT services and software, and the performance of individual companies. The index tends to be volatile, as it is sensitive to news and developments in the IT sector. For instance, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 had a significant impact on the IT industry, as many companies had to switch to remote work and adapt to new ways of working. As a result, the Nifty IT index experienced significant fluctuations during the pandemic.

The index constitutes a maximum of 12 companies listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and is computed through the free float market capitalization method. Investors or companies can use the Nifty Bank index for numerous purposes like benchmarking fund portfolios and launching index funds, ETFs and structured products.

What are the eligibility criteria for the selection of constituent stocks under Nifty Bank?

At the time of review, companies should be a part of NIFTY 500. If the number of eligible stocks falls below 10, then according to NSE, the deficit number of stocks should be selected from the available stocks ranked within the top 800 based on daily average turnover and daily average full market capitalisation based on the data of previous six months which is used for index rebalancing of NIFTY 500. The company should be a part of the banking sector and its trading frequency needs to be at least 90% in the past six months. A listing history of six months is necessary for the company but if it comes out with an initial public offer (IPO) then it can be included in the index if it fulfils the eligibility criteria for three months instead of six. Only those companies can be a part of the index which are allowed to trade in the F&O segment. The final selection of all 12 companies is done based on the free-float market capitalization methodology by calculating the weightage of each company in the index in such a way that no stock weighs more than 33% and the top 3 stocks cumulatively should not be more than 62% during rebalancing. The index rebalancing is done on a semi-annual basis.

Who manages the Bank Nifty Index?

A professional team manages all the indices of NSE and follows a three-tier governance structure which includes the board of directors of NSE Indices Ltd, Index Advisory Committee (Equity) and the Index Maintenance Sub-Committee.

What is the Bank Nifty futures & options contract?

According to NSE, the maturity date of the contract, the underlying index and a market lot are some characteristics of the futures contract. These contracts are available for trading from the intro to the expiry date. Bank Nifty futures have a maximum of 3-month trading cycle - the near month (one), the next month (two) and the far month (three). A new contract is introduced on the trading day following the expiry of the near-month contract. The contracts expire on the last Thursday of the expiry month.
