The US stock market experienced a strong first half, with the Nasdaq Composite posting its best opening six months in four decades. The rally, driven by mega-cap technology shares, was driven by the excitement around AI software and central bank interest-rate hikes. The S&P 500 also surged 15.9% in H1 2023, with technology stocks driving most of the rally, while the DJIA fell behind.

In the second half, if history is any indication, stocks may benefit from their good start. According to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, the S&P 500 has increased by an average of 8% in the second half of the year since 1945, when it increased by at least 10% in the first half.

The US stock market‚Äôs bullish momentum in the first half could continue into the second half, as was seen in 1929 when the S&P 500 index climbed an average of 4.3% in the second half after rising at least 14% in the first six months. From October lows, the indices have rallied into the bull market, up by almost 20%. In October 2022, the market was trading at a 23% discount to a composite of Morningstar‚Äôs fundamental stock valuations, a level not seen since 2010.

Factors playing out in H2 are recession, interest rates, and the global economy. Although a recession is currently thought to be less likely to occur this year, economic worries still exist. A 71% risk of a recession in the coming 12 months was predicted by a New York Federal Reserve model of recession probability based on the Treasury yield curve earlier this month.

The second-largest economy in the world, China, announced second-quarter GDP growth of 6.3%, which was less than analysts had anticipated.

According to the International Monetary Fund, headline inflation appears to have peaked among the Group of 20 countries. Core inflation, however, continues to be significantly higher than the central banks‚Äô goal levels in the majority of G20 nations, especially the advanced economies.

Bull markets do not follow a straight line. Pullbacks, and possibly a correction, are to be expected in the second half. Since 1950, the average maximum downside for the S&P 500 during a calendar year has been minus 13.8%, which is significantly lower than this year‚Äôs current maximum drawdown of negative 7.8%.

Furthermore, historically, positive first-half S&P 500 gains have resulted in shorter second-half drawdowns. For example, the average second-half maximum drawdown after a positive first half is negative 9%, as opposed to an average drawdown of negative 13.1% when the first half was negative, according to data compiled by LPL Financial.

The technology industry has reached ‚Äúovervalued territory‚Äù in terms of valuation, and these megacap technology stocks ‚Äúhave already run their course.‚Äù Now is a good time to take a look at your portfolio and reallocate those assets that are overextended.

According to a theory put forth by Yale Hirsch of the Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac, the stock market exhibits a pattern that corresponds with a four-year presidential term. While typically the third year of a presidential cycle has seen the best performance of all four, the future for equities now appears even more promising."

Since 2019, the railway station has been under expansion. It added double railway lines alongside the electrification of the tracks. The new design will add new amenities (such as more washrooms, lounges, dormitories, and ticket office). Its capacity will be increased to handle the greater passenger numbers expected due to the construction of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya.

The new construction is in two phases:

a) The first phase includes the erection of the new station building

b) The second phase will develop the platforms."

The tech giant has plans to use the feature to create backgrounds for Google Meet calls. With this tool, it will allow the users to enter a text prompt to generate a background for the call.

Google Meet is starting to roll out AI background image support.

You can enter a prompt, such as ‚ÄúLuxurious living room interior,‚Äù and even choose a reference style, such as ‚ÄúPhotography,‚Äù ‚ÄúIllustration,‚Äù or ‚ÄúFantasy.‚Äù Other suggestions for backdrops that were produced based on the prompt are also available.

Google has also provided a mechanism that allows the user to provide feedback if they find the generated content unsafe.

When Google unveiled a new feature for Android in May at its Google I/O developer conference, the firm conducted an earlier trial with AI-powered background generation. For Snapchat+ subscribers, Snap also unveiled a generative AI-based background creation function in April.

This year, the tech giant added a number of useful features to Google Meet, including emoji replies, the ability to pause individual tile streams, support for 1080p streaming, and video tile pairing for users in the educational sector.

Previously, in April, Google Meet allowed users to pause video streams of individual tiles.

A new ‚ÄúAudio only‚Äù mode for mobile devices disables all streams other than the presenter‚Äôs feed.

In January of this year, Google rolled out emoji reactions for people using Google Meet for video calls. Users can submit a reply emoji on the video conference by clicking or tapping the smile button in the bottom pane. This emoji supports a variety of skin tones. On the web, users‚Äô tiles will display a little emblem in the top-left corner when they respond with an emoji.

The momentous event, much-awaited and steeped in rivalry, would culminate in a showdown ‚Äì India versus Pakistan ‚Äì on the grounds of Kandy, Sri Lanka, on September 2. As sworn adversaries, both teams found themselves positioned in Group A alongside Nepal, possibly entangling in a fierce match thrice within 15 days, provided they reach the Super 4 and ultimately, the finals.

The tournament‚Äôs commencement date is August 30, and it will run until September 17. This six-team ODI tournament serves as a precursor to the ICC World Cup and will kick off in Multan, with a Pakistan vs Nepal match.

After their opening match against their arch-rivals, led by Rohit Sharma, Team India will have a one-day break before facing Nepal on September 4 in Kandy. A brief interlude of one day would then lead them to another contest, this time against Nepal on September 4.

How India vs Pakistan may happen thrice

Asian Cricket Council (ACC) President Jay Shah confirmed that regardless of their positions after the first round, Pakistan will remain A1, and India will remain A2. In case either of them fails to qualify, Nepal will take their position. If both India and Pakistan manage to qualify, they are scheduled to face each other once more in Colombo on September 10.

In Group B, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are designated as B1 and B2, respectively. If any of these teams fail to advance to the Super 4s, Afghanistan will take their place.

In June, the Asian Cricket Council had already unveiled the schedule of the hybrid model Asia Cup, with four matches being held in Pakistan and the remaining nine in Sri Lanka.

Given the strained political ties between India and Pakistan over the last decade and a half, bilateral cricket has suffered, leading the neighbouring countries to compete only in multi-team events at neutral venues. The Indian board expressed safety concerns and ruled out travelling to Pakistan for the Asia Cup in September, prompting the PCB to offer India the option of playing their matches in the United Arab Emirates, thus adopting the ‚Äúhybrid model.‚Äù

The participating teams in the tournament are India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and Nepal, making it a total of 13 ODI matches.

This year‚Äôs format features two groups of three teams each, with the top two from each group advancing to the Super Four stage. The top two teams from the Super Four will then compete in the final on September 17. Should India and Pakistan secure the top spots, they will meet for the third time ‚Äî the finals ‚Äî in the tournament in Colombo.

Nifty 50 expected to stay positive; support at 19800

‚ÄúNifty, the headline Indian Index, recently reached a fresh all-time high, stopping just 9 points shy of the 20,000 mark. The index‚Äôs value remains above the critical moving average, indicating a positive trend. Furthermore, the RSI shows a bullish crossover, suggesting potential market strength. In the short term, the index is expected to stay positive. However, if it fails to surpass the 20,000 level, investors might engage in profit-taking. There is a support level at 19,800, which could attract buying interest during potential pullbacks,‚Äù said Rupak De, Senior Technical analyst at LKP Securities.

Bank Nifty support at 45500, resistance at 46400-46500

‚ÄúThe index Bank Nifty is currently experiencing a strong bullish trend, with the bulls dominating the market. The index successfully surpassed the key resistance level of 46000, indicating a continuation of the upward momentum. The index is characterized by a series of ‚Äúhigher high and higher low formations,‚Äù which is a bullish pattern that confirms the strength of the uptrend,‚Äù said Kunal Shah, Senior Technical & Derivative analyst at LKP Securities.

‚ÄúThe support level for the index is at 45500, and as long as this level remains intact on a closing basis, the overall trend remains bullish.

Financials, FMCG & Healthcare stocks fired up Nifty, Sensex today

‚ÄúFinancials, FMCG & Healthcare fired up benchmark indices today which closed just shy of the magical 20k on the Nifty. FII‚Äôs have pulled off a 700-point rally in the Nifty since the 3rd of this month at the start of the earnings season for the first quarter,‚Äù said S Ranganathan, Head of Research at LKP securities.

Q1 results, FII inflow providing extra boost to Nifty, Sensex

‚ÄúUnlocking of value by heavyweights (like RIL & ITC) is apprising the main indices. The anticipation of good Q1 results from Banks, is providing an extra boost to drive to new highs. Mixed cues from global peers are not disturbing the mood of the domestic market as FIIs inflows stay put to the prospects of the Indian economy,‚Äù said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.

Investors might book profit if Nifty fails to surpass 20,000

‚ÄúNifty 50 remains above the critical moving average, indicating a positive trend. Furthermore, the RSI shows a bullish crossover, suggesting potential market strength. In the short term, the index is expected to stay positive. However, if it fails to surpass the 20,000 level, investors might engage in profit-taking. There is a support level of 19,800, which could attract buying interest during potential pullbacks,‚Äù said Rupak De, Senior Technical analyst at LKP Securities.

Bank Nifty support at 45500; resistance at 46400-46500

‚ÄúBank Nifty successfully surpassed the key resistance level of 46000, indicating a continuation of the upward momentum. The index is characterized by a series of ‚Äúhigher high and higher low formations,‚Äù which is a bullish pattern that confirms the strength of the uptrend.

It is a subset of the Nifty 50 index, representing the top 50 companies listed on India's National Stock Exchange (NSE). The Nifty IT index comprises the top 10 IT companies listed on the NSE, based on their market capitalisation. These companies are among the largest IT services and software providers in India, and some of them are also global players in their respective domains.

The Nifty IT index is a market capitalization-weighted index, which means that the weightage of each company in the index is proportional to its market capitalization. This implies that the performance of larger companies has a greater impact on the index than smaller companies. The Nifty IT index is an important benchmark for investors interested in investing in the IT sector in India. It provides a broad view of the performance of the IT industry, which is a key sector of the Indian economy. The index is also a reference point for index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the IT sector in India.

The performance of the Nifty IT index is influenced by various factors, including the global trends in the IT industry, the demand for IT services and software, and the performance of individual companies. The index tends to be volatile, as it is sensitive to news and developments in the IT sector. For instance, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 had a significant impact on the IT industry, as many companies had to switch to remote work and adapt to new ways of working. As a result, the Nifty IT index experienced significant fluctuations during the pandemic.

It records the market performance of the Indian banks giving investors and market intermediaries a benchmark so they can evaluate properly before investing. The index constitutes a maximum of 12 companies listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and is computed through the free float market capitalization method. Investors or companies can use the Nifty Bank index for numerous purposes like benchmarking fund portfolios and launching index funds, ETFs and structured products. Though it was launched on September 15, 2003, Nifty Bank‚Äôs base value on the base date i.e, January 01, 2000, was set at 1000 and has given a CAGR of 24.61% in the first 10 years.

What are the eligibility criteria for the selection of constituent stocks under Nifty Bank?

At the time of review, companies should be a part of NIFTY 500. If the number of eligible stocks falls below 10, then according to NSE, the deficit number of stocks should be selected from the available stocks ranked within the top 800 based on daily average turnover and daily average full market capitalisation based on the data of previous six months which is used for index rebalancing of NIFTY 500. The company should be a part of the banking sector and its trading frequency needs to be at least 90% in the past six months. A listing history of six months is necessary for the company but if it comes out with an initial public offer (IPO) then it can be included in the index if it fulfils the eligibility criteria for three months instead of six. Only those companies can be a part of the index which are allowed to trade in the F&O segment. The final selection of all 12 companies is done based on the free-float market capitalization methodology by calculating the weightage of each company in the index in such a way that no stock weighs more than 33% and the top 3 stocks cumulatively should not be more than 62% during rebalancing. The index rebalancing is done on a semi-annual basis.

Who manages the Bank Nifty Index?

A professional team manages all the indices of NSE and follows a three-tier governance structure which includes the board of directors of NSE Indices Ltd, Index Advisory Committee (Equity) and the Index Maintenance Sub-Committee.

What is the Bank Nifty futures & options contract?

A forward contract trading on an exchange is called a futures contract. The Bank Nifty futures contracts are based on the Bank Nifty index. According to NSE, the maturity date of the contract, the underlying index and a market lot are some characteristics of the futures contract. These contracts are available for trading from the intro to the expiry date. Bank Nifty futures have a maximum of 3-month trading cycle - the near month (one), the next month (two) and the far month (three). A new contract is introduced on the trading day following the expiry of the near-month contract. The contracts expire on the last Thursday of the expiry month. If it is a trading holiday on the last Thursday, then contracts expire on the previous trading day."

The US stock market experienced a strong first half, with the Nasdaq Composite posting its best opening six months in four decades. The rally, driven by mega-cap technology shares, was driven by the excitement around AI software and central bank interest-rate hikes. The S&P 500 also surged 15.9% in H1 2023, with technology stocks driving most of the rally, while the DJIA fell behind.

In the second half, if history is any indication, stocks may benefit from their good start. According to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, the S&P 500 has increased by an average of 8% in the second half of the year since 1945, when it increased by at least 10% in the first half.

The US stock market‚Äôs bullish momentum in the first half could continue into the second half, as was seen in 1929 when the S&P 500 index climbed an average of 4.3% in the second half after rising at least 14% in the first six months. From October lows, the indices have rallied into the bull market, up by almost 20%. In October 2022, the market was trading at a 23% discount to a composite of Morningstar‚Äôs fundamental stock valuations, a level not seen since 2010.

Factors playing out in H2 are recession, interest rates, and the global economy. Although a recession is currently thought to be less likely to occur this year, economic worries still exist. A 71% risk of a recession in the coming 12 months was predicted by a New York Federal Reserve model of recession probability based on the Treasury yield curve earlier this month.

The second-largest economy in the world, China, announced second-quarter GDP growth of 6.3%, which was less than analysts had anticipated.

According to the International Monetary Fund, headline inflation appears to have peaked among the Group of 20 countries. Core inflation, however, continues to be significantly higher than the central banks‚Äô goal levels in the majority of G20 nations, especially the advanced economies.

Bull markets do not follow a straight line. Pullbacks, and possibly a correction, are to be expected in the second half. Since 1950, the average maximum downside for the S&P 500 during a calendar year has been minus 13.8%, which is significantly lower than this year‚Äôs current maximum drawdown of negative 7.8%.

Furthermore, historically, positive first-half S&P 500 gains have resulted in shorter second-half drawdowns. For example, the average second-half maximum drawdown after a positive first half is negative 9%, as opposed to an average drawdown of negative 13.1% when the first half was negative, according to data compiled by LPL Financial.

The technology industry has reached ‚Äúovervalued territory‚Äù in terms of valuation, and these megacap technology stocks ‚Äúhave already run their course.‚Äù Now is a good time to take a look at your portfolio and reallocate those assets that are overextended.

According to a theory put forth by Yale Hirsch of the Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac, the stock market exhibits a pattern that corresponds with a four-year presidential term. While typically the third year of a presidential cycle has seen the best performance of all four, the future for equities now appears even more promising."

The new design will add new amenities (such as more washrooms, lounges, dormitories, and ticket office).

The tech giant has plans to use the feature to create backgrounds for Google Meet calls. With this tool, it will allow the users to enter a text prompt to generate a background for the call.

The feature is a part of Google Workspace Labs and was first announced by Artem Russakovsii on Twitter. This implies that just a select few test participants will have access to it.

Google Meet is starting to roll out AI background image support.

According to Google‚Äôs support, users that are part of the test must click Apply Visual Effects. Then one must locate ‚ÄúGenerate a background‚Äù to open the prompt in order to access these features. You can enter a prompt, such as ‚ÄúLuxurious living room interior,‚Äù and even choose a reference style, such as ‚ÄúPhotography,‚Äù ‚ÄúIllustration,‚Äù or ‚ÄúFantasy.‚Äù Other suggestions for backdrops that were produced based on the prompt are also available.

Google has also provided a mechanism that allows the user to provide feedback if they find the generated content unsafe.

When Google unveiled a new feature for Android in May at its Google I/O developer conference, the firm conducted an earlier trial with AI-powered background generation. For Snapchat+ subscribers, Snap also unveiled a generative AI-based background creation function in April.

This year, the tech giant added a number of useful features to Google Meet, including emoji replies, the ability to pause individual tile streams, support for 1080p streaming, and video tile pairing for users in the educational sector.

Previously, in April, Google Meet allowed users to pause video streams of individual tiles. On the web, click ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt watch‚Äù from the three-dot option next to a user‚Äôs name in the sidebar to disable that person‚Äôs feeds. A new ‚ÄúAudio only‚Äù mode for mobile devices disables all streams other than the presenter‚Äôs feed.

In January of this year, Google rolled out emoji reactions for people using Google Meet for video calls. Users can submit a reply emoji on the video conference by clicking or tapping the smile button in the bottom pane. This emoji supports a variety of skin tones. On the web, users‚Äô tiles will display a little emblem in the top-left corner when they respond with an emoji. You will see a stream of reactions on the left-hand side if several people are reacting at once, just like comments on a live video.

The momentous event, much-awaited and steeped in rivalry, would culminate in a showdown ‚Äì India versus Pakistan ‚Äì on the grounds of Kandy, Sri Lanka, on September 2. As sworn adversaries, both teams found themselves positioned in Group A alongside Nepal, possibly entangling in a fierce match thrice within 15 days, provided they reach the Super 4 and ultimately, the finals.

The tournament‚Äôs commencement date is August 30, and it will run until September 17. This six-team ODI tournament serves as a precursor to the ICC World Cup and will kick off in Multan, with a Pakistan vs Nepal match.

After their opening match against their arch-rivals, led by Rohit Sharma, Team India will have a one-day break before facing Nepal on September 4 in Kandy. A brief interlude of one day would then lead them to another contest, this time against Nepal on September 4.

How India vs Pakistan may happen thrice

Asian Cricket Council (ACC) President Jay Shah confirmed that regardless of their positions after the first round, Pakistan will remain A1, and India will remain A2. In case either of them fails to qualify, Nepal will take their position. If both India and Pakistan manage to qualify, they are scheduled to face each other once more in Colombo on September 10.

In Group B, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are designated as B1 and B2, respectively. If any of these teams fail to advance to the Super 4s, Afghanistan will take their place.

In June, the Asian Cricket Council had already unveiled the schedule of the hybrid model Asia Cup, with four matches being held in Pakistan and the remaining nine in Sri Lanka.

Given the strained political ties between India and Pakistan over the last decade and a half, bilateral cricket has suffered, leading the neighbouring countries to compete only in multi-team events at neutral venues. The Indian board expressed safety concerns and ruled out travelling to Pakistan for the Asia Cup in September, prompting the PCB to offer India the option of playing their matches in the United Arab Emirates, thus adopting the ‚Äúhybrid model.‚Äù

The participating teams in the tournament are India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and Nepal, making it a total of 13 ODI matches.

This year‚Äôs format features two groups of three teams each, with the top two from each group advancing to the Super Four stage. The top two teams from the Super Four will then compete in the final on September 17. Should India and Pakistan secure the top spots, they will meet for the third time ‚Äî the finals ‚Äî in the tournament in Colombo.

It is a subset of the Nifty 50 index, representing the top 50 companies listed on India's National Stock Exchange (NSE). The Nifty IT index comprises the top 10 IT companies listed on the NSE, based on their market capitalisation. These companies are among the largest IT services and software providers in India, and some of them are also global players in their respective domains.

The Nifty IT index is a market capitalization-weighted index, which means that the weightage of each company in the index is proportional to its market capitalization. This implies that the performance of larger companies has a greater impact on the index than smaller companies. The Nifty IT index is an important benchmark for investors interested in investing in the IT sector in India. It provides a broad view of the performance of the IT industry, which is a key sector of the Indian economy. The index is also a reference point for index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the IT sector in India.

The performance of the Nifty IT index is influenced by various factors, including the global trends in the IT industry, the demand for IT services and software, and the performance of individual companies. The index tends to be volatile, as it is sensitive to news and developments in the IT sector. For instance, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 had a significant impact on the IT industry, as many companies had to switch to remote work and adapt to new ways of working. As a result, the Nifty IT index experienced significant fluctuations during the pandemic.

The US stock market experienced a strong first half, with the Nasdaq Composite posting its best opening six months in four decades. The rally, driven by mega-cap technology shares, was driven by the excitement around AI software and central bank interest-rate hikes. The S&P 500 also surged 15.9% in H1 2023, with technology stocks driving most of the rally, while the DJIA fell behind.

In the second half, if history is any indication, stocks may benefit from their good start. According to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, the S&P 500 has increased by an average of 8% in the second half of the year since 1945, when it increased by at least 10% in the first half.

The US stock market‚Äôs bullish momentum in the first half could continue into the second half, as was seen in 1929 when the S&P 500 index climbed an average of 4.3% in the second half after rising at least 14% in the first six months. From October lows, the indices have rallied into the bull market, up by almost 20%. In October 2022, the market was trading at a 23% discount to a composite of Morningstar‚Äôs fundamental stock valuations, a level not seen since 2010.

Factors playing out in H2 are recession, interest rates, and the global economy. Although a recession is currently thought to be less likely to occur this year, economic worries still exist. A 71% risk of a recession in the coming 12 months was predicted by a New York Federal Reserve model of recession probability based on the Treasury yield curve earlier this month.

The second-largest economy in the world, China, announced second-quarter GDP growth of 6.3%, which was less than analysts had anticipated.

According to the International Monetary Fund, headline inflation appears to have peaked among the Group of 20 countries. Core inflation, however, continues to be significantly higher than the central banks‚Äô goal levels in the majority of G20 nations, especially the advanced economies.

Bull markets do not follow a straight line. Pullbacks, and possibly a correction, are to be expected in the second half. Since 1950, the average maximum downside for the S&P 500 during a calendar year has been minus 13.8%, which is significantly lower than this year‚Äôs current maximum drawdown of negative 7.8%.

Furthermore, historically, positive first-half S&P 500 gains have resulted in shorter second-half drawdowns. For example, the average second-half maximum drawdown after a positive first half is negative 9%, as opposed to an average drawdown of negative 13.1% when the first half was negative, according to data compiled by LPL Financial.

The technology industry has reached ‚Äúovervalued territory‚Äù in terms of valuation, and these megacap technology stocks ‚Äúhave already run their course.‚Äù Now is a good time to take a look at your portfolio and reallocate those assets that are overextended.

According to a theory put forth by Yale Hirsch of the Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac, the stock market exhibits a pattern that corresponds with a four-year presidential term. While typically the third year of a presidential cycle has seen the best performance of all four, the future for equities now appears even more promising."

The momentous event, much-awaited and steeped in rivalry, would culminate in a showdown ‚Äì India versus Pakistan ‚Äì on the grounds of Kandy, Sri Lanka, on September 2. As sworn adversaries, both teams found themselves positioned in Group A alongside Nepal, possibly entangling in a fierce match thrice within 15 days, provided they reach the Super 4 and ultimately, the finals.

The tournament‚Äôs commencement date is August 30, and it will run until September 17. This six-team ODI tournament serves as a precursor to the ICC World Cup and will kick off in Multan, with a Pakistan vs Nepal match.

After their opening match against their arch-rivals, led by Rohit Sharma, Team India will have a one-day break before facing Nepal on September 4 in Kandy. A brief interlude of one day would then lead them to another contest, this time against Nepal on September 4.

How India vs Pakistan may happen thrice

Asian Cricket Council (ACC) President Jay Shah confirmed that regardless of their positions after the first round, Pakistan will remain A1, and India will remain A2. In case either of them fails to qualify, Nepal will take their position. If both India and Pakistan manage to qualify, they are scheduled to face each other once more in Colombo on September 10.

In Group B, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are designated as B1 and B2, respectively. If any of these teams fail to advance to the Super 4s, Afghanistan will take their place.

In June, the Asian Cricket Council had already unveiled the schedule of the hybrid model Asia Cup, with four matches being held in Pakistan and the remaining nine in Sri Lanka.

Given the strained political ties between India and Pakistan over the last decade and a half, bilateral cricket has suffered, leading the neighbouring countries to compete only in multi-team events at neutral venues. The Indian board expressed safety concerns and ruled out travelling to Pakistan for the Asia Cup in September, prompting the PCB to offer India the option of playing their matches in the United Arab Emirates, thus adopting the ‚Äúhybrid model.‚Äù

The participating teams in the tournament are India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and Nepal, making it a total of 13 ODI matches.

This year‚Äôs format features two groups of three teams each, with the top two from each group advancing to the Super Four stage. The top two teams from the Super Four will then compete in the final on September 17. Should India and Pakistan secure the top spots, they will meet for the third time ‚Äî the finals ‚Äî in the tournament in Colombo.

The index‚Äôs value remains above the critical moving average, indicating a positive trend. Furthermore, the RSI shows a bullish crossover, suggesting potential market strength. In the short term, the index is expected to stay positive. However, if it fails to surpass the 20,000 level, investors might engage in profit-taking.

‚ÄúThe index Bank Nifty is currently experiencing a strong bullish trend, with the bulls dominating the market.

‚ÄúFinancials, FMCG & Healthcare fired up benchmark indices today which closed just shy of the magical 20k on the Nifty.

Q1 results, FII inflow providing extra boost to Nifty, Sensex

‚ÄúUnlocking of value by heavyweights (like RIL & ITC) is apprising the main indices. The anticipation of good Q1 results from Banks, is providing an extra boost to drive to new highs.

‚ÄúNifty 50 remains above the critical moving average, indicating a positive trend. Furthermore, the RSI shows a bullish crossover, suggesting potential market strength. In the short term, the index is expected to stay positive. However, if it fails to surpass the 20,000 level, investors might engage in profit-taking.

It is a subset of the Nifty 50 index, representing the top 50 companies listed on India's National Stock Exchange (NSE). The Nifty IT index comprises the top 10 IT companies listed on the NSE, based on their market capitalisation. These companies are among the largest IT services and software providers in India, and some of them are also global players in their respective domains.

The Nifty IT index is a market capitalization-weighted index, which means that the weightage of each company in the index is proportional to its market capitalization. This implies that the performance of larger companies has a greater impact on the index than smaller companies. The Nifty IT index is an important benchmark for investors interested in investing in the IT sector in India. It provides a broad view of the performance of the IT industry, which is a key sector of the Indian economy. The index is also a reference point for index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the IT sector in India.

The performance of the Nifty IT index is influenced by various factors, including the global trends in the IT industry, the demand for IT services and software, and the performance of individual companies. The index tends to be volatile, as it is sensitive to news and developments in the IT sector. For instance, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 had a significant impact on the IT industry, as many companies had to switch to remote work and adapt to new ways of working. As a result, the Nifty IT index experienced significant fluctuations during the pandemic.

It records the market performance of the Indian banks giving investors and market intermediaries a benchmark so they can evaluate properly before investing. The index constitutes a maximum of 12 companies listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and is computed through the free float market capitalization method. Investors or companies can use the Nifty Bank index for numerous purposes like benchmarking fund portfolios and launching index funds, ETFs and structured products. Though it was launched on September 15, 2003, Nifty Bank‚Äôs base value on the base date i.e, January 01, 2000, was set at 1000 and has given a CAGR of 24.61% in the first 10 years.

What are the eligibility criteria for the selection of constituent stocks under Nifty Bank?

At the time of review, companies should be a part of NIFTY 500. If the number of eligible stocks falls below 10, then according to NSE, the deficit number of stocks should be selected from the available stocks ranked within the top 800 based on daily average turnover and daily average full market capitalisation based on the data of previous six months which is used for index rebalancing of NIFTY 500. The company should be a part of the banking sector and its trading frequency needs to be at least 90% in the past six months. A listing history of six months is necessary for the company but if it comes out with an initial public offer (IPO) then it can be included in the index if it fulfils the eligibility criteria for three months instead of six. Only those companies can be a part of the index which are allowed to trade in the F&O segment. The final selection of all 12 companies is done based on the free-float market capitalization methodology by calculating the weightage of each company in the index in such a way that no stock weighs more than 33% and the top 3 stocks cumulatively should not be more than 62% during rebalancing. The index rebalancing is done on a semi-annual basis.

Who manages the Bank Nifty Index?

A professional team manages all the indices of NSE and follows a three-tier governance structure which includes the board of directors of NSE Indices Ltd, Index Advisory Committee (Equity) and the Index Maintenance Sub-Committee.

What is the Bank Nifty futures & options contract?

A forward contract trading on an exchange is called a futures contract. The Bank Nifty futures contracts are based on the Bank Nifty index. According to NSE, the maturity date of the contract, the underlying index and a market lot are some characteristics of the futures contract. These contracts are available for trading from the intro to the expiry date. Bank Nifty futures have a maximum of 3-month trading cycle - the near month (one), the next month (two) and the far month (three). A new contract is introduced on the trading day following the expiry of the near-month contract. The contracts expire on the last Thursday of the expiry month. If it is a trading holiday on the last Thursday, then contracts expire on the previous trading day."

The US stock market experienced a strong first half, with the Nasdaq Composite posting its best opening six months in four decades. The rally, driven by mega-cap technology shares, was driven by the excitement around AI software and central bank interest-rate hikes. The S&P 500 also surged 15.9% in H1 2023, with technology stocks driving most of the rally, while the DJIA fell behind.

In the second half, if history is any indication, stocks may benefit from their good start. According to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, the S&P 500 has increased by an average of 8% in the second half of the year since 1945, when it increased by at least 10% in the first half.

The US stock market‚Äôs bullish momentum in the first half could continue into the second half, as was seen in 1929 when the S&P 500 index climbed an average of 4.3% in the second half after rising at least 14% in the first six months. From October lows, the indices have rallied into the bull market, up by almost 20%. In October 2022, the market was trading at a 23% discount to a composite of Morningstar‚Äôs fundamental stock valuations, a level not seen since 2010.

Factors playing out in H2 are recession, interest rates, and the global economy. Although a recession is currently thought to be less likely to occur this year, economic worries still exist. A 71% risk of a recession in the coming 12 months was predicted by a New York Federal Reserve model of recession probability based on the Treasury yield curve earlier this month.

The second-largest economy in the world, China, announced second-quarter GDP growth of 6.3%, which was less than analysts had anticipated.

According to the International Monetary Fund, headline inflation appears to have peaked among the Group of 20 countries. Core inflation, however, continues to be significantly higher than the central banks‚Äô goal levels in the majority of G20 nations, especially the advanced economies.

Bull markets do not follow a straight line. Pullbacks, and possibly a correction, are to be expected in the second half. Since 1950, the average maximum downside for the S&P 500 during a calendar year has been minus 13.8%, which is significantly lower than this year‚Äôs current maximum drawdown of negative 7.8%.

Furthermore, historically, positive first-half S&P 500 gains have resulted in shorter second-half drawdowns. For example, the average second-half maximum drawdown after a positive first half is negative 9%, as opposed to an average drawdown of negative 13.1% when the first half was negative, according to data compiled by LPL Financial.

The technology industry has reached ‚Äúovervalued territory‚Äù in terms of valuation, and these megacap technology stocks ‚Äúhave already run their course.‚Äù Now is a good time to take a look at your portfolio and reallocate those assets that are overextended.

According to a theory put forth by Yale Hirsch of the Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac, the stock market exhibits a pattern that corresponds with a four-year presidential term. While typically the third year of a presidential cycle has seen the best performance of all four, the future for equities now appears even more promising."

The executive agency for the project is M/S RITES Ltd (Rail India Technical and Economic Service Limited).

Since 2019, the railway station has been under expansion. It added double railway lines alongside the electrification of the tracks. The new design will add new amenities (such as more washrooms, lounges, dormitories, and ticket office). Its capacity will be increased to handle the greater passenger numbers expected due to the construction of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya.

The new construction is in two phases:

The momentous event, much-awaited and steeped in rivalry, would culminate in a showdown ‚Äì India versus Pakistan ‚Äì on the grounds of Kandy, Sri Lanka, on September 2. As sworn adversaries, both teams found themselves positioned in Group A alongside Nepal, possibly entangling in a fierce match thrice within 15 days, provided they reach the Super 4 and ultimately, the finals.

The tournament‚Äôs commencement date is August 30, and it will run until September 17. This six-team ODI tournament serves as a precursor to the ICC World Cup and will kick off in Multan, with a Pakistan vs Nepal match.

After their opening match against their arch-rivals, led by Rohit Sharma, Team India will have a one-day break before facing Nepal on September 4 in Kandy. A brief interlude of one day would then lead them to another contest, this time against Nepal on September 4.

How India vs Pakistan may happen thrice

Asian Cricket Council (ACC) President Jay Shah confirmed that regardless of their positions after the first round, Pakistan will remain A1, and India will remain A2. In case either of them fails to qualify, Nepal will take their position. If both India and Pakistan manage to qualify, they are scheduled to face each other once more in Colombo on September 10.

In Group B, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are designated as B1 and B2, respectively. If any of these teams fail to advance to the Super 4s, Afghanistan will take their place.

In June, the Asian Cricket Council had already unveiled the schedule of the hybrid model Asia Cup, with four matches being held in Pakistan and the remaining nine in Sri Lanka.

Given the strained political ties between India and Pakistan over the last decade and a half, bilateral cricket has suffered, leading the neighbouring countries to compete only in multi-team events at neutral venues. The Indian board expressed safety concerns and ruled out travelling to Pakistan for the Asia Cup in September, prompting the PCB to offer India the option of playing their matches in the United Arab Emirates, thus adopting the ‚Äúhybrid model.‚Äù

The participating teams in the tournament are India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and Nepal, making it a total of 13 ODI matches.

This year‚Äôs format features two groups of three teams each, with the top two from each group advancing to the Super Four stage. The top two teams from the Super Four will then compete in the final on September 17. Should India and Pakistan secure the top spots, they will meet for the third time ‚Äî the finals ‚Äî in the tournament in Colombo.

The index is also a reference point for index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the IT sector in India.

The performance of the Nifty IT index is influenced by various factors, including the global trends in the IT industry, the demand for IT services and software, and the performance of individual companies. The index tends to be volatile, as it is sensitive to news and developments in the IT sector. For instance, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 had a significant impact on the IT industry, as many companies had to switch to remote work and adapt to new ways of working.

It records the market performance of the Indian banks giving investors and market intermediaries a benchmark so they can evaluate properly before investing. The index constitutes a maximum of 12 companies listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and is computed through the free float market capitalization method. Investors or companies can use the Nifty Bank index for numerous purposes like benchmarking fund portfolios and launching index funds, ETFs and structured products. Though it was launched on September 15, 2003, Nifty Bank‚Äôs base value on the base date i.e, January 01, 2000, was set at 1000 and has given a CAGR of 24.61% in the first 10 years.

What are the eligibility criteria for the selection of constituent stocks under Nifty Bank?

At the time of review, companies should be a part of NIFTY 500. If the number of eligible stocks falls below 10, then according to NSE, the deficit number of stocks should be selected from the available stocks ranked within the top 800 based on daily average turnover and daily average full market capitalisation based on the data of previous six months which is used for index rebalancing of NIFTY 500. The company should be a part of the banking sector and its trading frequency needs to be at least 90% in the past six months. A listing history of six months is necessary for the company but if it comes out with an initial public offer (IPO) then it can be included in the index if it fulfils the eligibility criteria for three months instead of six. Only those companies can be a part of the index which are allowed to trade in the F&O segment. The final selection of all 12 companies is done based on the free-float market capitalization methodology by calculating the weightage of each company in the index in such a way that no stock weighs more than 33% and the top 3 stocks cumulatively should not be more than 62% during rebalancing. The index rebalancing is done on a semi-annual basis.

Who manages the Bank Nifty Index?

A professional team manages all the indices of NSE and follows a three-tier governance structure which includes the board of directors of NSE Indices Ltd, Index Advisory Committee (Equity) and the Index Maintenance Sub-Committee.

What is the Bank Nifty futures & options contract?

A forward contract trading on an exchange is called a futures contract. The Bank Nifty futures contracts are based on the Bank Nifty index. According to NSE, the maturity date of the contract, the underlying index and a market lot are some characteristics of the futures contract. These contracts are available for trading from the intro to the expiry date. Bank Nifty futures have a maximum of 3-month trading cycle - the near month (one), the next month (two) and the far month (three). A new contract is introduced on the trading day following the expiry of the near-month contract. The contracts expire on the last Thursday of the expiry month. If it is a trading holiday on the last Thursday, then contracts expire on the previous trading day."

The US stock market experienced a strong first half, with the Nasdaq Composite posting its best opening six months in four decades. The rally, driven by mega-cap technology shares, was driven by the excitement around AI software and central bank interest-rate hikes. The S&P 500 also surged 15.9% in H1 2023, with technology stocks driving most of the rally, while the DJIA fell behind.

In the second half, if history is any indication, stocks may benefit from their good start. According to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, the S&P 500 has increased by an average of 8% in the second half of the year since 1945, when it increased by at least 10% in the first half.

The US stock market‚Äôs bullish momentum in the first half could continue into the second half, as was seen in 1929 when the S&P 500 index climbed an average of 4.3% in the second half after rising at least 14% in the first six months. From October lows, the indices have rallied into the bull market, up by almost 20%. In October 2022, the market was trading at a 23% discount to a composite of Morningstar‚Äôs fundamental stock valuations, a level not seen since 2010.

Factors playing out in H2 are recession, interest rates, and the global economy. Although a recession is currently thought to be less likely to occur this year, economic worries still exist. A 71% risk of a recession in the coming 12 months was predicted by a New York Federal Reserve model of recession probability based on the Treasury yield curve earlier this month.

The second-largest economy in the world, China, announced second-quarter GDP growth of 6.3%, which was less than analysts had anticipated.

According to the International Monetary Fund, headline inflation appears to have peaked among the Group of 20 countries. Core inflation, however, continues to be significantly higher than the central banks‚Äô goal levels in the majority of G20 nations, especially the advanced economies.

Bull markets do not follow a straight line. Pullbacks, and possibly a correction, are to be expected in the second half. Since 1950, the average maximum downside for the S&P 500 during a calendar year has been minus 13.8%, which is significantly lower than this year‚Äôs current maximum drawdown of negative 7.8%.

Furthermore, historically, positive first-half S&P 500 gains have resulted in shorter second-half drawdowns. For example, the average second-half maximum drawdown after a positive first half is negative 9%, as opposed to an average drawdown of negative 13.1% when the first half was negative, according to data compiled by LPL Financial.

The technology industry has reached ‚Äúovervalued territory‚Äù in terms of valuation, and these megacap technology stocks ‚Äúhave already run their course.‚Äù Now is a good time to take a look at your portfolio and reallocate those assets that are overextended.

According to a theory put forth by Yale Hirsch of the Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac, the stock market exhibits a pattern that corresponds with a four-year presidential term. While typically the third year of a presidential cycle has seen the best performance of all four, the future for equities now appears even more promising."

The momentous event, much-awaited and steeped in rivalry, would culminate in a showdown ‚Äì India versus Pakistan ‚Äì on the grounds of Kandy, Sri Lanka, on September 2. As sworn adversaries, both teams found themselves positioned in Group A alongside Nepal, possibly entangling in a fierce match thrice within 15 days, provided they reach the Super 4 and ultimately, the finals.

The tournament‚Äôs commencement date is August 30, and it will run until September 17. This six-team ODI tournament serves as a precursor to the ICC World Cup and will kick off in Multan, with a Pakistan vs Nepal match.

After their opening match against their arch-rivals, led by Rohit Sharma, Team India will have a one-day break before facing Nepal on September 4 in Kandy. A brief interlude of one day would then lead them to another contest, this time against Nepal on September 4.

How India vs Pakistan may happen thrice

Asian Cricket Council (ACC) President Jay Shah confirmed that regardless of their positions after the first round, Pakistan will remain A1, and India will remain A2. In case either of them fails to qualify, Nepal will take their position. If both India and Pakistan manage to qualify, they are scheduled to face each other once more in Colombo on September 10.

In Group B, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are designated as B1 and B2, respectively. If any of these teams fail to advance to the Super 4s, Afghanistan will take their place.

In June, the Asian Cricket Council had already unveiled the schedule of the hybrid model Asia Cup, with four matches being held in Pakistan and the remaining nine in Sri Lanka.

Given the strained political ties between India and Pakistan over the last decade and a half, bilateral cricket has suffered, leading the neighbouring countries to compete only in multi-team events at neutral venues. The Indian board expressed safety concerns and ruled out travelling to Pakistan for the Asia Cup in September, prompting the PCB to offer India the option of playing their matches in the United Arab Emirates, thus adopting the ‚Äúhybrid model.‚Äù

The participating teams in the tournament are India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and Nepal, making it a total of 13 ODI matches.

This year‚Äôs format features two groups of three teams each, with the top two from each group advancing to the Super Four stage. The top two teams from the Super Four will then compete in the final on September 17. Should India and Pakistan secure the top spots, they will meet for the third time ‚Äî the finals ‚Äî in the tournament in Colombo.

Nifty 50 expected to stay positive; support at 19800

‚ÄúNifty, the headline Indian Index, recently reached a fresh all-time high, stopping just 9 points shy of the 20,000 mark. The index‚Äôs value remains above the critical moving average, indicating a positive trend. Furthermore, the RSI shows a bullish crossover, suggesting potential market strength. In the short term, the index is expected to stay positive. However, if it fails to surpass the 20,000 level, investors might engage in profit-taking.

‚ÄúThe index Bank Nifty is currently experiencing a strong bullish trend, with the bulls dominating the market.

The index is characterized by a series of ‚Äúhigher high and higher low formations,‚Äù which is a bullish pattern that confirms the strength of the uptrend,‚Äù said Kunal Shah, Senior Technical & Derivative analyst at LKP Securities.

‚ÄúThe support level for the index is at 45500, and as long as this level remains intact on a closing basis, the overall trend remains bullish. A break below this support level could signal a potential shift in momentum and may warrant caution for bulls. On the upside, the next immediate hurdle is placed at the 46400-46500 zone.

Q1 results, FII inflow providing extra boost to Nifty, Sensex

‚ÄúUnlocking of value by heavyweights (like RIL & ITC) is apprising the main indices. The anticipation of good Q1 results from Banks, is providing an extra boost to drive to new highs.

‚ÄúNifty 50 remains above the critical moving average, indicating a positive trend. Furthermore, the RSI shows a bullish crossover, suggesting potential market strength.

It is a subset of the Nifty 50 index, representing the top 50 companies listed on India's National Stock Exchange (NSE). The Nifty IT index comprises the top 10 IT companies listed on the NSE, based on their market capitalisation. These companies are among the largest IT services and software providers in India, and some of them are also global players in their respective domains.

The Nifty IT index is a market capitalization-weighted index, which means that the weightage of each company in the index is proportional to its market capitalization. This implies that the performance of larger companies has a greater impact on the index than smaller companies. The Nifty IT index is an important benchmark for investors interested in investing in the IT sector in India. It provides a broad view of the performance of the IT industry, which is a key sector of the Indian economy. The index is also a reference point for index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the IT sector in India.

The performance of the Nifty IT index is influenced by various factors, including the global trends in the IT industry, the demand for IT services and software, and the performance of individual companies. The index tends to be volatile, as it is sensitive to news and developments in the IT sector. For instance, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 had a significant impact on the IT industry, as many companies had to switch to remote work and adapt to new ways of working. As a result, the Nifty IT index experienced significant fluctuations during the pandemic.

What are the eligibility criteria for the selection of constituent stocks under Nifty Bank?

At the time of review, companies should be a part of NIFTY 500. If the number of eligible stocks falls below 10, then according to NSE, the deficit number of stocks should be selected from the available stocks ranked within the top 800 based on daily average turnover and daily average full market capitalisation based on the data of previous six months which is used for index rebalancing of NIFTY 500. The company should be a part of the banking sector and its trading frequency needs to be at least 90% in the past six months. A listing history of six months is necessary for the company but if it comes out with an initial public offer (IPO) then it can be included in the index if it fulfils the eligibility criteria for three months instead of six. Only those companies can be a part of the index which are allowed to trade in the F&O segment. The final selection of all 12 companies is done based on the free-float market capitalization methodology by calculating the weightage of each company in the index in such a way that no stock weighs more than 33% and the top 3 stocks cumulatively should not be more than 62% during rebalancing. The index rebalancing is done on a semi-annual basis.

Who manages the Bank Nifty Index?

A professional team manages all the indices of NSE and follows a three-tier governance structure which includes the board of directors of NSE Indices Ltd, Index Advisory Committee (Equity) and the Index Maintenance Sub-Committee.

What is the Bank Nifty futures & options contract?

According to NSE, the maturity date of the contract, the underlying index and a market lot are some characteristics of the futures contract. These contracts are available for trading from the intro to the expiry date. Bank Nifty futures have a maximum of 3-month trading cycle - the near month (one), the next month (two) and the far month (three). A new contract is introduced on the trading day following the expiry of the near-month contract. The contracts expire on the last Thursday of the expiry month.

The US stock market experienced a strong first half, with the Nasdaq Composite posting its best opening six months in four decades. The rally, driven by mega-cap technology shares, was driven by the excitement around AI software and central bank interest-rate hikes. The S&P 500 also surged 15.9% in H1 2023, with technology stocks driving most of the rally, while the DJIA fell behind.

In the second half, if history is any indication, stocks may benefit from their good start. According to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, the S&P 500 has increased by an average of 8% in the second half of the year since 1945, when it increased by at least 10% in the first half.

The US stock market‚Äôs bullish momentum in the first half could continue into the second half, as was seen in 1929 when the S&P 500 index climbed an average of 4.3% in the second half after rising at least 14% in the first six months. From October lows, the indices have rallied into the bull market, up by almost 20%. In October 2022, the market was trading at a 23% discount to a composite of Morningstar‚Äôs fundamental stock valuations, a level not seen since 2010.

Factors playing out in H2 are recession, interest rates, and the global economy. Although a recession is currently thought to be less likely to occur this year, economic worries still exist. A 71% risk of a recession in the coming 12 months was predicted by a New York Federal Reserve model of recession probability based on the Treasury yield curve earlier this month.

The second-largest economy in the world, China, announced second-quarter GDP growth of 6.3%, which was less than analysts had anticipated.

According to the International Monetary Fund, headline inflation appears to have peaked among the Group of 20 countries. Core inflation, however, continues to be significantly higher than the central banks‚Äô goal levels in the majority of G20 nations, especially the advanced economies.

Bull markets do not follow a straight line. Pullbacks, and possibly a correction, are to be expected in the second half. Since 1950, the average maximum downside for the S&P 500 during a calendar year has been minus 13.8%, which is significantly lower than this year‚Äôs current maximum drawdown of negative 7.8%.

Furthermore, historically, positive first-half S&P 500 gains have resulted in shorter second-half drawdowns. For example, the average second-half maximum drawdown after a positive first half is negative 9%, as opposed to an average drawdown of negative 13.1% when the first half was negative, according to data compiled by LPL Financial.

The technology industry has reached ‚Äúovervalued territory‚Äù in terms of valuation, and these megacap technology stocks ‚Äúhave already run their course.‚Äù Now is a good time to take a look at your portfolio and reallocate those assets that are overextended.

According to a theory put forth by Yale Hirsch of the Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac, the stock market exhibits a pattern that corresponds with a four-year presidential term. While typically the third year of a presidential cycle has seen the best performance of all four, the future for equities now appears even more promising."

The momentous event, much-awaited and steeped in rivalry, would culminate in a showdown ‚Äì India versus Pakistan ‚Äì on the grounds of Kandy, Sri Lanka, on September 2. As sworn adversaries, both teams found themselves positioned in Group A alongside Nepal, possibly entangling in a fierce match thrice within 15 days, provided they reach the Super 4 and ultimately, the finals.

The tournament‚Äôs commencement date is August 30, and it will run until September 17. This six-team ODI tournament serves as a precursor to the ICC World Cup and will kick off in Multan, with a Pakistan vs Nepal match.

After their opening match against their arch-rivals, led by Rohit Sharma, Team India will have a one-day break before facing Nepal on September 4 in Kandy. A brief interlude of one day would then lead them to another contest, this time against Nepal on September 4.

How India vs Pakistan may happen thrice

Asian Cricket Council (ACC) President Jay Shah confirmed that regardless of their positions after the first round, Pakistan will remain A1, and India will remain A2. In case either of them fails to qualify, Nepal will take their position. If both India and Pakistan manage to qualify, they are scheduled to face each other once more in Colombo on September 10.

In Group B, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are designated as B1 and B2, respectively. If any of these teams fail to advance to the Super 4s, Afghanistan will take their place.

In June, the Asian Cricket Council had already unveiled the schedule of the hybrid model Asia Cup, with four matches being held in Pakistan and the remaining nine in Sri Lanka.

Given the strained political ties between India and Pakistan over the last decade and a half, bilateral cricket has suffered, leading the neighbouring countries to compete only in multi-team events at neutral venues. The Indian board expressed safety concerns and ruled out travelling to Pakistan for the Asia Cup in September, prompting the PCB to offer India the option of playing their matches in the United Arab Emirates, thus adopting the ‚Äúhybrid model.‚Äù

The participating teams in the tournament are India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and Nepal, making it a total of 13 ODI matches.

This year‚Äôs format features two groups of three teams each, with the top two from each group advancing to the Super Four stage. The top two teams from the Super Four will then compete in the final on September 17. Should India and Pakistan secure the top spots, they will meet for the third time ‚Äî the finals ‚Äî in the tournament in Colombo.

The index‚Äôs value remains above the critical moving average, indicating a positive trend. Furthermore, the RSI shows a bullish crossover, suggesting potential market strength. In the short term, the index is expected to stay positive. However, if it fails to surpass the 20,000 level, investors might engage in profit-taking.

Financials, FMCG & Healthcare stocks fired up Nifty, Sensex today

‚ÄúFinancials, FMCG & Healthcare fired up benchmark indices today which closed just shy of the magical 20k on the Nifty. FII‚Äôs have pulled off a 700-point rally in the Nifty since the 3rd of this month at the start of the earnings season for the first quarter,‚Äù said S Ranganathan, Head of Research at LKP securities.

Q1 results, FII inflow providing extra boost to Nifty, Sensex

‚ÄúUnlocking of value by heavyweights (like RIL & ITC) is apprising the main indices. The anticipation of good Q1 results from Banks, is providing an extra boost to drive to new highs. Mixed cues from global peers are not disturbing the mood of the domestic market as FIIs inflows stay put to the prospects of the Indian economy,‚Äù said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.

Investors might book profit if Nifty fails to surpass 20,000

‚ÄúNifty 50 remains above the critical moving average, indicating a positive trend. Furthermore, the RSI shows a bullish crossover, suggesting potential market strength. In the short term, the index is expected to stay positive. However, if it fails to surpass the 20,000 level, investors might engage in profit-taking. There is a support level of 19,800, which could attract buying interest during potential pullbacks,‚Äù said Rupak De, Senior Technical analyst at LKP Securities.

Bank Nifty support at 45500; resistance at 46400-46500

‚ÄúBank Nifty successfully surpassed the key resistance level of 46000, indicating a continuation of the upward momentum. The index is characterized by a series of ‚Äúhigher high and higher low formations,‚Äù which is a bullish pattern that confirms the strength of the uptrend. The support level for the index is at 45500, and as long as this level remains intact on a closing basis, the overall trend remains bullish. On the upside, the next immediate hurdle is placed at the 46400-46500 zone,‚Äù said Kunal Shah, Senior Technical & Derivative analyst at LKP Securities."

It is a subset of the Nifty 50 index, representing the top 50 companies listed on India's National Stock Exchange (NSE). The Nifty IT index comprises the top 10 IT companies listed on the NSE, based on their market capitalisation. These companies are among the largest IT services and software providers in India, and some of them are also global players in their respective domains.

The Nifty IT index is a market capitalization-weighted index, which means that the weightage of each company in the index is proportional to its market capitalization. This implies that the performance of larger companies has a greater impact on the index than smaller companies. The Nifty IT index is an important benchmark for investors interested in investing in the IT sector in India. It provides a broad view of the performance of the IT industry, which is a key sector of the Indian economy. The index is also a reference point for index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the IT sector in India.

The performance of the Nifty IT index is influenced by various factors, including the global trends in the IT industry, the demand for IT services and software, and the performance of individual companies. The index tends to be volatile, as it is sensitive to news and developments in the IT sector. For instance, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 had a significant impact on the IT industry, as many companies had to switch to remote work and adapt to new ways of working. As a result, the Nifty IT index experienced significant fluctuations during the pandemic.

It records the market performance of the Indian banks giving investors and market intermediaries a benchmark so they can evaluate properly before investing. The index constitutes a maximum of 12 companies listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and is computed through the free float market capitalization method. Investors or companies can use the Nifty Bank index for numerous purposes like benchmarking fund portfolios and launching index funds, ETFs and structured products. Though it was launched on September 15, 2003, Nifty Bank‚Äôs base value on the base date i.e, January 01, 2000, was set at 1000 and has given a CAGR of 24.61% in the first 10 years.

What are the eligibility criteria for the selection of constituent stocks under Nifty Bank?

At the time of review, companies should be a part of NIFTY 500. If the number of eligible stocks falls below 10, then according to NSE, the deficit number of stocks should be selected from the available stocks ranked within the top 800 based on daily average turnover and daily average full market capitalisation based on the data of previous six months which is used for index rebalancing of NIFTY 500. The company should be a part of the banking sector and its trading frequency needs to be at least 90% in the past six months. A listing history of six months is necessary for the company but if it comes out with an initial public offer (IPO) then it can be included in the index if it fulfils the eligibility criteria for three months instead of six. Only those companies can be a part of the index which are allowed to trade in the F&O segment. The final selection of all 12 companies is done based on the free-float market capitalization methodology by calculating the weightage of each company in the index in such a way that no stock weighs more than 33% and the top 3 stocks cumulatively should not be more than 62% during rebalancing. The index rebalancing is done on a semi-annual basis.

Who manages the Bank Nifty Index?

A professional team manages all the indices of NSE and follows a three-tier governance structure which includes the board of directors of NSE Indices Ltd, Index Advisory Committee (Equity) and the Index Maintenance Sub-Committee.

What is the Bank Nifty futures & options contract?

A forward contract trading on an exchange is called a futures contract. The Bank Nifty futures contracts are based on the Bank Nifty index. According to NSE, the maturity date of the contract, the underlying index and a market lot are some characteristics of the futures contract. These contracts are available for trading from the intro to the expiry date. Bank Nifty futures have a maximum of 3-month trading cycle - the near month (one), the next month (two) and the far month (three). A new contract is introduced on the trading day following the expiry of the near-month contract. The contracts expire on the last Thursday of the expiry month. If it is a trading holiday on the last Thursday, then contracts expire on the previous trading day."

The US stock market experienced a strong first half, with the Nasdaq Composite posting its best opening six months in four decades. The rally, driven by mega-cap technology shares, was driven by the excitement around AI software and central bank interest-rate hikes. The S&P 500 also surged 15.9% in H1 2023, with technology stocks driving most of the rally, while the DJIA fell behind.

In the second half, if history is any indication, stocks may benefit from their good start. According to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, the S&P 500 has increased by an average of 8% in the second half of the year since 1945, when it increased by at least 10% in the first half.

The US stock market‚Äôs bullish momentum in the first half could continue into the second half, as was seen in 1929 when the S&P 500 index climbed an average of 4.3% in the second half after rising at least 14% in the first six months. From October lows, the indices have rallied into the bull market, up by almost 20%. In October 2022, the market was trading at a 23% discount to a composite of Morningstar‚Äôs fundamental stock valuations, a level not seen since 2010.

Factors playing out in H2 are recession, interest rates, and the global economy. Although a recession is currently thought to be less likely to occur this year, economic worries still exist. A 71% risk of a recession in the coming 12 months was predicted by a New York Federal Reserve model of recession probability based on the Treasury yield curve earlier this month.

The second-largest economy in the world, China, announced second-quarter GDP growth of 6.3%, which was less than analysts had anticipated.

According to the International Monetary Fund, headline inflation appears to have peaked among the Group of 20 countries. Core inflation, however, continues to be significantly higher than the central banks‚Äô goal levels in the majority of G20 nations, especially the advanced economies.

Bull markets do not follow a straight line. Pullbacks, and possibly a correction, are to be expected in the second half. Since 1950, the average maximum downside for the S&P 500 during a calendar year has been minus 13.8%, which is significantly lower than this year‚Äôs current maximum drawdown of negative 7.8%.

Furthermore, historically, positive first-half S&P 500 gains have resulted in shorter second-half drawdowns. For example, the average second-half maximum drawdown after a positive first half is negative 9%, as opposed to an average drawdown of negative 13.1% when the first half was negative, according to data compiled by LPL Financial.

The technology industry has reached ‚Äúovervalued territory‚Äù in terms of valuation, and these megacap technology stocks ‚Äúhave already run their course.‚Äù Now is a good time to take a look at your portfolio and reallocate those assets that are overextended.

According to a theory put forth by Yale Hirsch of the Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac, the stock market exhibits a pattern that corresponds with a four-year presidential term. While typically the third year of a presidential cycle has seen the best performance of all four, the future for equities now appears even more promising."

The momentous event, much-awaited and steeped in rivalry, would culminate in a showdown ‚Äì India versus Pakistan ‚Äì on the grounds of Kandy, Sri Lanka, on September 2. As sworn adversaries, both teams found themselves positioned in Group A alongside Nepal, possibly entangling in a fierce match thrice within 15 days, provided they reach the Super 4 and ultimately, the finals.

The tournament‚Äôs commencement date is August 30, and it will run until September 17. This six-team ODI tournament serves as a precursor to the ICC World Cup and will kick off in Multan, with a Pakistan vs Nepal match.

After their opening match against their arch-rivals, led by Rohit Sharma, Team India will have a one-day break before facing Nepal on September 4 in Kandy. A brief interlude of one day would then lead them to another contest, this time against Nepal on September 4.

How India vs Pakistan may happen thrice

Asian Cricket Council (ACC) President Jay Shah confirmed that regardless of their positions after the first round, Pakistan will remain A1, and India will remain A2. In case either of them fails to qualify, Nepal will take their position. If both India and Pakistan manage to qualify, they are scheduled to face each other once more in Colombo on September 10.

In Group B, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are designated as B1 and B2, respectively. If any of these teams fail to advance to the Super 4s, Afghanistan will take their place.

In June, the Asian Cricket Council had already unveiled the schedule of the hybrid model Asia Cup, with four matches being held in Pakistan and the remaining nine in Sri Lanka.

Given the strained political ties between India and Pakistan over the last decade and a half, bilateral cricket has suffered, leading the neighbouring countries to compete only in multi-team events at neutral venues. The Indian board expressed safety concerns and ruled out travelling to Pakistan for the Asia Cup in September, prompting the PCB to offer India the option of playing their matches in the United Arab Emirates, thus adopting the ‚Äúhybrid model.‚Äù

The participating teams in the tournament are India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and Nepal, making it a total of 13 ODI matches.

This year‚Äôs format features two groups of three teams each, with the top two from each group advancing to the Super Four stage. The top two teams from the Super Four will then compete in the final on September 17. Should India and Pakistan secure the top spots, they will meet for the third time ‚Äî the finals ‚Äî in the tournament in Colombo.

The performance of the Nifty IT index is influenced by various factors, including the global trends in the IT industry, the demand for IT services and software, and the performance of individual companies.

Though it was launched on September 15, 2003, Nifty Bank‚Äôs base value on the base date i.e, January 01, 2000, was set at 1000 and has given a CAGR of 24.61% in the first 10 years.

What are the eligibility criteria for the selection of constituent stocks under Nifty Bank?

At the time of review, companies should be a part of NIFTY 500. If the number of eligible stocks falls below 10, then according to NSE, the deficit number of stocks should be selected from the available stocks ranked within the top 800 based on daily average turnover and daily average full market capitalisation based on the data of previous six months which is used for index rebalancing of NIFTY 500. The company should be a part of the banking sector and its trading frequency needs to be at least 90% in the past six months. A listing history of six months is necessary for the company but if it comes out with an initial public offer (IPO) then it can be included in the index if it fulfils the eligibility criteria for three months instead of six. Only those companies can be a part of the index which are allowed to trade in the F&O segment. The final selection of all 12 companies is done based on the free-float market capitalization methodology by calculating the weightage of each company in the index in such a way that no stock weighs more than 33% and the top 3 stocks cumulatively should not be more than 62% during rebalancing. The index rebalancing is done on a semi-annual basis.

Who manages the Bank Nifty Index?

A professional team manages all the indices of NSE and follows a three-tier governance structure which includes the board of directors of NSE Indices Ltd, Index Advisory Committee (Equity) and the Index Maintenance Sub-Committee.

What is the Bank Nifty futures & options contract?

A forward contract trading on an exchange is called a futures contract. The Bank Nifty futures contracts are based on the Bank Nifty index. According to NSE, the maturity date of the contract, the underlying index and a market lot are some characteristics of the futures contract. These contracts are available for trading from the intro to the expiry date. Bank Nifty futures have a maximum of 3-month trading cycle - the near month (one), the next month (two) and the far month (three). A new contract is introduced on the trading day following the expiry of the near-month contract. The contracts expire on the last Thursday of the expiry month. If it is a trading holiday on the last Thursday, then contracts expire on the previous trading day."

The US stock market experienced a strong first half, with the Nasdaq Composite posting its best opening six months in four decades. The rally, driven by mega-cap technology shares, was driven by the excitement around AI software and central bank interest-rate hikes. The S&P 500 also surged 15.9% in H1 2023, with technology stocks driving most of the rally, while the DJIA fell behind.

In the second half, if history is any indication, stocks may benefit from their good start. According to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, the S&P 500 has increased by an average of 8% in the second half of the year since 1945, when it increased by at least 10% in the first half.

The US stock market‚Äôs bullish momentum in the first half could continue into the second half, as was seen in 1929 when the S&P 500 index climbed an average of 4.3% in the second half after rising at least 14% in the first six months. From October lows, the indices have rallied into the bull market, up by almost 20%. In October 2022, the market was trading at a 23% discount to a composite of Morningstar‚Äôs fundamental stock valuations, a level not seen since 2010.

Factors playing out in H2 are recession, interest rates, and the global economy. Although a recession is currently thought to be less likely to occur this year, economic worries still exist. A 71% risk of a recession in the coming 12 months was predicted by a New York Federal Reserve model of recession probability based on the Treasury yield curve earlier this month.

The second-largest economy in the world, China, announced second-quarter GDP growth of 6.3%, which was less than analysts had anticipated.

According to the International Monetary Fund, headline inflation appears to have peaked among the Group of 20 countries. Core inflation, however, continues to be significantly higher than the central banks‚Äô goal levels in the majority of G20 nations, especially the advanced economies.

Bull markets do not follow a straight line. Pullbacks, and possibly a correction, are to be expected in the second half. Since 1950, the average maximum downside for the S&P 500 during a calendar year has been minus 13.8%, which is significantly lower than this year‚Äôs current maximum drawdown of negative 7.8%.

Furthermore, historically, positive first-half S&P 500 gains have resulted in shorter second-half drawdowns. For example, the average second-half maximum drawdown after a positive first half is negative 9%, as opposed to an average drawdown of negative 13.1% when the first half was negative, according to data compiled by LPL Financial.

The technology industry has reached ‚Äúovervalued territory‚Äù in terms of valuation, and these megacap technology stocks ‚Äúhave already run their course.‚Äù Now is a good time to take a look at your portfolio and reallocate those assets that are overextended.

According to a theory put forth by Yale Hirsch of the Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac, the stock market exhibits a pattern that corresponds with a four-year presidential term. While typically the third year of a presidential cycle has seen the best performance of all four, the future for equities now appears even more promising."

The momentous event, much-awaited and steeped in rivalry, would culminate in a showdown ‚Äì India versus Pakistan ‚Äì on the grounds of Kandy, Sri Lanka, on September 2. As sworn adversaries, both teams found themselves positioned in Group A alongside Nepal, possibly entangling in a fierce match thrice within 15 days, provided they reach the Super 4 and ultimately, the finals.

The tournament‚Äôs commencement date is August 30, and it will run until September 17. This six-team ODI tournament serves as a precursor to the ICC World Cup and will kick off in Multan, with a Pakistan vs Nepal match.

After their opening match against their arch-rivals, led by Rohit Sharma, Team India will have a one-day break before facing Nepal on September 4 in Kandy. A brief interlude of one day would then lead them to another contest, this time against Nepal on September 4.

How India vs Pakistan may happen thrice

Asian Cricket Council (ACC) President Jay Shah confirmed that regardless of their positions after the first round, Pakistan will remain A1, and India will remain A2. In case either of them fails to qualify, Nepal will take their position. If both India and Pakistan manage to qualify, they are scheduled to face each other once more in Colombo on September 10.

In Group B, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are designated as B1 and B2, respectively. If any of these teams fail to advance to the Super 4s, Afghanistan will take their place.

In June, the Asian Cricket Council had already unveiled the schedule of the hybrid model Asia Cup, with four matches being held in Pakistan and the remaining nine in Sri Lanka.

Given the strained political ties between India and Pakistan over the last decade and a half, bilateral cricket has suffered, leading the neighbouring countries to compete only in multi-team events at neutral venues. The Indian board expressed safety concerns and ruled out travelling to Pakistan for the Asia Cup in September, prompting the PCB to offer India the option of playing their matches in the United Arab Emirates, thus adopting the ‚Äúhybrid model.‚Äù

The participating teams in the tournament are India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and Nepal, making it a total of 13 ODI matches.

This year‚Äôs format features two groups of three teams each, with the top two from each group advancing to the Super Four stage. The top two teams from the Super Four will then compete in the final on September 17. Should India and Pakistan secure the top spots, they will meet for the third time ‚Äî the finals ‚Äî in the tournament in Colombo.

In the short term, the index is expected to stay positive. However, if it fails to surpass the 20,000 level, investors might engage in profit-taking.

Financials, FMCG & Healthcare stocks fired up Nifty, Sensex today

‚ÄúFinancials, FMCG & Healthcare fired up benchmark indices today which closed just shy of the magical 20k on the Nifty. FII‚Äôs have pulled off a 700-point rally in the Nifty since the 3rd of this month at the start of the earnings season for the first quarter,‚Äù said S Ranganathan, Head of Research at LKP securities.

Q1 results, FII inflow providing extra boost to Nifty, Sensex

‚ÄúUnlocking of value by heavyweights (like RIL & ITC) is apprising the main indices. The anticipation of good Q1 results from Banks, is providing an extra boost to drive to new highs. Mixed cues from global peers are not disturbing the mood of the domestic market as FIIs inflows stay put to the prospects of the Indian economy,‚Äù said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.

Investors might book profit if Nifty fails to surpass 20,000

‚ÄúNifty 50 remains above the critical moving average, indicating a positive trend. Furthermore, the RSI shows a bullish crossover, suggesting potential market strength. In the short term, the index is expected to stay positive. However, if it fails to surpass the 20,000 level, investors might engage in profit-taking. There is a support level of 19,800, which could attract buying interest during potential pullbacks,‚Äù said Rupak De, Senior Technical analyst at LKP Securities.

Bank Nifty support at 45500; resistance at 46400-46500

‚ÄúBank Nifty successfully surpassed the key resistance level of 46000, indicating a continuation of the upward momentum. The index is characterized by a series of ‚Äúhigher high and higher low formations,‚Äù which is a bullish pattern that confirms the strength of the uptrend. The support level for the index is at 45500, and as long as this level remains intact on a closing basis, the overall trend remains bullish. On the upside, the next immediate hurdle is placed at the 46400-46500 zone,‚Äù said Kunal Shah, Senior Technical & Derivative analyst at LKP Securities."

It is a subset of the Nifty 50 index, representing the top 50 companies listed on India's National Stock Exchange (NSE). The Nifty IT index comprises the top 10 IT companies listed on the NSE, based on their market capitalisation. These companies are among the largest IT services and software providers in India, and some of them are also global players in their respective domains.

The Nifty IT index is a market capitalization-weighted index, which means that the weightage of each company in the index is proportional to its market capitalization. This implies that the performance of larger companies has a greater impact on the index than smaller companies. The Nifty IT index is an important benchmark for investors interested in investing in the IT sector in India. It provides a broad view of the performance of the IT industry, which is a key sector of the Indian economy. The index is also a reference point for index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the IT sector in India.

The performance of the Nifty IT index is influenced by various factors, including the global trends in the IT industry, the demand for IT services and software, and the performance of individual companies. The index tends to be volatile, as it is sensitive to news and developments in the IT sector. For instance, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 had a significant impact on the IT industry, as many companies had to switch to remote work and adapt to new ways of working. As a result, the Nifty IT index experienced significant fluctuations during the pandemic.

It records the market performance of the Indian banks giving investors and market intermediaries a benchmark so they can evaluate properly before investing. The index constitutes a maximum of 12 companies listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and is computed through the free float market capitalization method. Investors or companies can use the Nifty Bank index for numerous purposes like benchmarking fund portfolios and launching index funds, ETFs and structured products. Though it was launched on September 15, 2003, Nifty Bank‚Äôs base value on the base date i.e, January 01, 2000, was set at 1000 and has given a CAGR of 24.61% in the first 10 years.

What are the eligibility criteria for the selection of constituent stocks under Nifty Bank?

At the time of review, companies should be a part of NIFTY 500. If the number of eligible stocks falls below 10, then according to NSE, the deficit number of stocks should be selected from the available stocks ranked within the top 800 based on daily average turnover and daily average full market capitalisation based on the data of previous six months which is used for index rebalancing of NIFTY 500. The company should be a part of the banking sector and its trading frequency needs to be at least 90% in the past six months. A listing history of six months is necessary for the company but if it comes out with an initial public offer (IPO) then it can be included in the index if it fulfils the eligibility criteria for three months instead of six. Only those companies can be a part of the index which are allowed to trade in the F&O segment. The final selection of all 12 companies is done based on the free-float market capitalization methodology by calculating the weightage of each company in the index in such a way that no stock weighs more than 33% and the top 3 stocks cumulatively should not be more than 62% during rebalancing. The index rebalancing is done on a semi-annual basis.

Who manages the Bank Nifty Index?

A professional team manages all the indices of NSE and follows a three-tier governance structure which includes the board of directors of NSE Indices Ltd, Index Advisory Committee (Equity) and the Index Maintenance Sub-Committee.

What is the Bank Nifty futures & options contract?

A forward contract trading on an exchange is called a futures contract. The Bank Nifty futures contracts are based on the Bank Nifty index. According to NSE, the maturity date of the contract, the underlying index and a market lot are some characteristics of the futures contract. These contracts are available for trading from the intro to the expiry date. Bank Nifty futures have a maximum of 3-month trading cycle - the near month (one), the next month (two) and the far month (three). A new contract is introduced on the trading day following the expiry of the near-month contract. The contracts expire on the last Thursday of the expiry month. If it is a trading holiday on the last Thursday, then contracts expire on the previous trading day."

The US stock market experienced a strong first half, with the Nasdaq Composite posting its best opening six months in four decades. The rally, driven by mega-cap technology shares, was driven by the excitement around AI software and central bank interest-rate hikes. The S&P 500 also surged 15.9% in H1 2023, with technology stocks driving most of the rally, while the DJIA fell behind.

In the second half, if history is any indication, stocks may benefit from their good start. According to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, the S&P 500 has increased by an average of 8% in the second half of the year since 1945, when it increased by at least 10% in the first half.

The US stock market‚Äôs bullish momentum in the first half could continue into the second half, as was seen in 1929 when the S&P 500 index climbed an average of 4.3% in the second half after rising at least 14% in the first six months. From October lows, the indices have rallied into the bull market, up by almost 20%. In October 2022, the market was trading at a 23% discount to a composite of Morningstar‚Äôs fundamental stock valuations, a level not seen since 2010.

Factors playing out in H2 are recession, interest rates, and the global economy. Although a recession is currently thought to be less likely to occur this year, economic worries still exist. A 71% risk of a recession in the coming 12 months was predicted by a New York Federal Reserve model of recession probability based on the Treasury yield curve earlier this month.

The second-largest economy in the world, China, announced second-quarter GDP growth of 6.3%, which was less than analysts had anticipated.

According to the International Monetary Fund, headline inflation appears to have peaked among the Group of 20 countries. Core inflation, however, continues to be significantly higher than the central banks‚Äô goal levels in the majority of G20 nations, especially the advanced economies.

Bull markets do not follow a straight line. Pullbacks, and possibly a correction, are to be expected in the second half. Since 1950, the average maximum downside for the S&P 500 during a calendar year has been minus 13.8%, which is significantly lower than this year‚Äôs current maximum drawdown of negative 7.8%.

Furthermore, historically, positive first-half S&P 500 gains have resulted in shorter second-half drawdowns. For example, the average second-half maximum drawdown after a positive first half is negative 9%, as opposed to an average drawdown of negative 13.1% when the first half was negative, according to data compiled by LPL Financial.

The technology industry has reached ‚Äúovervalued territory‚Äù in terms of valuation, and these megacap technology stocks ‚Äúhave already run their course.‚Äù Now is a good time to take a look at your portfolio and reallocate those assets that are overextended.

According to a theory put forth by Yale Hirsch of the Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac, the stock market exhibits a pattern that corresponds with a four-year presidential term. While typically the third year of a presidential cycle has seen the best performance of all four, the future for equities now appears even more promising."

The momentous event, much-awaited and steeped in rivalry, would culminate in a showdown ‚Äì India versus Pakistan ‚Äì on the grounds of Kandy, Sri Lanka, on September 2. As sworn adversaries, both teams found themselves positioned in Group A alongside Nepal, possibly entangling in a fierce match thrice within 15 days, provided they reach the Super 4 and ultimately, the finals.

The tournament‚Äôs commencement date is August 30, and it will run until September 17. This six-team ODI tournament serves as a precursor to the ICC World Cup and will kick off in Multan, with a Pakistan vs Nepal match.

After their opening match against their arch-rivals, led by Rohit Sharma, Team India will have a one-day break before facing Nepal on September 4 in Kandy. A brief interlude of one day would then lead them to another contest, this time against Nepal on September 4.

How India vs Pakistan may happen thrice

Asian Cricket Council (ACC) President Jay Shah confirmed that regardless of their positions after the first round, Pakistan will remain A1, and India will remain A2. In case either of them fails to qualify, Nepal will take their position. If both India and Pakistan manage to qualify, they are scheduled to face each other once more in Colombo on September 10.

In Group B, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are designated as B1 and B2, respectively. If any of these teams fail to advance to the Super 4s, Afghanistan will take their place.

In June, the Asian Cricket Council had already unveiled the schedule of the hybrid model Asia Cup, with four matches being held in Pakistan and the remaining nine in Sri Lanka.

Given the strained political ties between India and Pakistan over the last decade and a half, bilateral cricket has suffered, leading the neighbouring countries to compete only in multi-team events at neutral venues. The Indian board expressed safety concerns and ruled out travelling to Pakistan for the Asia Cup in September, prompting the PCB to offer India the option of playing their matches in the United Arab Emirates, thus adopting the ‚Äúhybrid model.‚Äù

The participating teams in the tournament are India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and Nepal, making it a total of 13 ODI matches.

This year‚Äôs format features two groups of three teams each, with the top two from each group advancing to the Super Four stage. The top two teams from the Super Four will then compete in the final on September 17. Should India and Pakistan secure the top spots, they will meet for the third time ‚Äî the finals ‚Äî in the tournament in Colombo.

The performance of the Nifty IT index is influenced by various factors, including the global trends in the IT industry, the demand for IT services and software, and the performance of individual companies.

Though it was launched on September 15, 2003, Nifty Bank‚Äôs base value on the base date i.e, January 01, 2000, was set at 1000 and has given a CAGR of 24.61% in the first 10 years.

What are the eligibility criteria for the selection of constituent stocks under Nifty Bank?

At the time of review, companies should be a part of NIFTY 500. If the number of eligible stocks falls below 10, then according to NSE, the deficit number of stocks should be selected from the available stocks ranked within the top 800 based on daily average turnover and daily average full market capitalisation based on the data of previous six months which is used for index rebalancing of NIFTY 500. The company should be a part of the banking sector and its trading frequency needs to be at least 90% in the past six months. A listing history of six months is necessary for the company but if it comes out with an initial public offer (IPO) then it can be included in the index if it fulfils the eligibility criteria for three months instead of six. Only those companies can be a part of the index which are allowed to trade in the F&O segment. The final selection of all 12 companies is done based on the free-float market capitalization methodology by calculating the weightage of each company in the index in such a way that no stock weighs more than 33% and the top 3 stocks cumulatively should not be more than 62% during rebalancing. The index rebalancing is done on a semi-annual basis.

Who manages the Bank Nifty Index?

A professional team manages all the indices of NSE and follows a three-tier governance structure which includes the board of directors of NSE Indices Ltd, Index Advisory Committee (Equity) and the Index Maintenance Sub-Committee.

What is the Bank Nifty futures & options contract?

A forward contract trading on an exchange is called a futures contract. The Bank Nifty futures contracts are based on the Bank Nifty index. According to NSE, the maturity date of the contract, the underlying index and a market lot are some characteristics of the futures contract. These contracts are available for trading from the intro to the expiry date. Bank Nifty futures have a maximum of 3-month trading cycle - the near month (one), the next month (two) and the far month (three). A new contract is introduced on the trading day following the expiry of the near-month contract. The contracts expire on the last Thursday of the expiry month. If it is a trading holiday on the last Thursday, then contracts expire on the previous trading day."

The US stock market experienced a strong first half, with the Nasdaq Composite posting its best opening six months in four decades. The rally, driven by mega-cap technology shares, was driven by the excitement around AI software and central bank interest-rate hikes. The S&P 500 also surged 15.9% in H1 2023, with technology stocks driving most of the rally, while the DJIA fell behind.

In the second half, if history is any indication, stocks may benefit from their good start. According to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, the S&P 500 has increased by an average of 8% in the second half of the year since 1945, when it increased by at least 10% in the first half.

The US stock market‚Äôs bullish momentum in the first half could continue into the second half, as was seen in 1929 when the S&P 500 index climbed an average of 4.3% in the second half after rising at least 14% in the first six months. From October lows, the indices have rallied into the bull market, up by almost 20%. In October 2022, the market was trading at a 23% discount to a composite of Morningstar‚Äôs fundamental stock valuations, a level not seen since 2010.

Factors playing out in H2 are recession, interest rates, and the global economy. Although a recession is currently thought to be less likely to occur this year, economic worries still exist. A 71% risk of a recession in the coming 12 months was predicted by a New York Federal Reserve model of recession probability based on the Treasury yield curve earlier this month.

The second-largest economy in the world, China, announced second-quarter GDP growth of 6.3%, which was less than analysts had anticipated.

According to the International Monetary Fund, headline inflation appears to have peaked among the Group of 20 countries. Core inflation, however, continues to be significantly higher than the central banks‚Äô goal levels in the majority of G20 nations, especially the advanced economies.

Bull markets do not follow a straight line. Pullbacks, and possibly a correction, are to be expected in the second half. Since 1950, the average maximum downside for the S&P 500 during a calendar year has been minus 13.8%, which is significantly lower than this year‚Äôs current maximum drawdown of negative 7.8%.

Furthermore, historically, positive first-half S&P 500 gains have resulted in shorter second-half drawdowns. For example, the average second-half maximum drawdown after a positive first half is negative 9%, as opposed to an average drawdown of negative 13.1% when the first half was negative, according to data compiled by LPL Financial.

The technology industry has reached ‚Äúovervalued territory‚Äù in terms of valuation, and these megacap technology stocks ‚Äúhave already run their course.‚Äù Now is a good time to take a look at your portfolio and reallocate those assets that are overextended.

According to a theory put forth by Yale Hirsch of the Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac, the stock market exhibits a pattern that corresponds with a four-year presidential term. While typically the third year of a presidential cycle has seen the best performance of all four, the future for equities now appears even more promising."

The momentous event, much-awaited and steeped in rivalry, would culminate in a showdown ‚Äì India versus Pakistan ‚Äì on the grounds of Kandy, Sri Lanka, on September 2. As sworn adversaries, both teams found themselves positioned in Group A alongside Nepal, possibly entangling in a fierce match thrice within 15 days, provided they reach the Super 4 and ultimately, the finals.

The tournament‚Äôs commencement date is August 30, and it will run until September 17. This six-team ODI tournament serves as a precursor to the ICC World Cup and will kick off in Multan, with a Pakistan vs Nepal match.

After their opening match against their arch-rivals, led by Rohit Sharma, Team India will have a one-day break before facing Nepal on September 4 in Kandy. A brief interlude of one day would then lead them to another contest, this time against Nepal on September 4.

How India vs Pakistan may happen thrice

Asian Cricket Council (ACC) President Jay Shah confirmed that regardless of their positions after the first round, Pakistan will remain A1, and India will remain A2. In case either of them fails to qualify, Nepal will take their position. If both India and Pakistan manage to qualify, they are scheduled to face each other once more in Colombo on September 10.

In Group B, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are designated as B1 and B2, respectively. If any of these teams fail to advance to the Super 4s, Afghanistan will take their place.

In June, the Asian Cricket Council had already unveiled the schedule of the hybrid model Asia Cup, with four matches being held in Pakistan and the remaining nine in Sri Lanka.

Given the strained political ties between India and Pakistan over the last decade and a half, bilateral cricket has suffered, leading the neighbouring countries to compete only in multi-team events at neutral venues. The Indian board expressed safety concerns and ruled out travelling to Pakistan for the Asia Cup in September, prompting the PCB to offer India the option of playing their matches in the United Arab Emirates, thus adopting the ‚Äúhybrid model.‚Äù

The participating teams in the tournament are India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and Nepal, making it a total of 13 ODI matches.

This year‚Äôs format features two groups of three teams each, with the top two from each group advancing to the Super Four stage. The top two teams from the Super Four will then compete in the final on September 17. Should India and Pakistan secure the top spots, they will meet for the third time ‚Äî the finals ‚Äî in the tournament in Colombo.

In the short term, the index is expected to stay positive. However, if it fails to surpass the 20,000 level, investors might engage in profit-taking.

Financials, FMCG & Healthcare stocks fired up Nifty, Sensex today

‚ÄúFinancials, FMCG & Healthcare fired up benchmark indices today which closed just shy of the magical 20k on the Nifty. FII‚Äôs have pulled off a 700-point rally in the Nifty since the 3rd of this month at the start of the earnings season for the first quarter,‚Äù said S Ranganathan, Head of Research at LKP securities.

Q1 results, FII inflow providing extra boost to Nifty, Sensex

‚ÄúUnlocking of value by heavyweights (like RIL & ITC) is apprising the main indices. The anticipation of good Q1 results from Banks, is providing an extra boost to drive to new highs. Mixed cues from global peers are not disturbing the mood of the domestic market as FIIs inflows stay put to the prospects of the Indian economy,‚Äù said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.

Investors might book profit if Nifty fails to surpass 20,000

‚ÄúNifty 50 remains above the critical moving average, indicating a positive trend. Furthermore, the RSI shows a bullish crossover, suggesting potential market strength. In the short term, the index is expected to stay positive. However, if it fails to surpass the 20,000 level, investors might engage in profit-taking. There is a support level of 19,800, which could attract buying interest during potential pullbacks,‚Äù said Rupak De, Senior Technical analyst at LKP Securities.

Bank Nifty support at 45500; resistance at 46400-46500

‚ÄúBank Nifty successfully surpassed the key resistance level of 46000, indicating a continuation of the upward momentum. The index is characterized by a series of ‚Äúhigher high and higher low formations,‚Äù which is a bullish pattern that confirms the strength of the uptrend. The support level for the index is at 45500, and as long as this level remains intact on a closing basis, the overall trend remains bullish. On the upside, the next immediate hurdle is placed at the 46400-46500 zone,‚Äù said Kunal Shah, Senior Technical & Derivative analyst at LKP Securities."

It is a subset of the Nifty 50 index, representing the top 50 companies listed on India's National Stock Exchange (NSE). The Nifty IT index comprises the top 10 IT companies listed on the NSE, based on their market capitalisation. These companies are among the largest IT services and software providers in India, and some of them are also global players in their respective domains.

The Nifty IT index is a market capitalization-weighted index, which means that the weightage of each company in the index is proportional to its market capitalization. This implies that the performance of larger companies has a greater impact on the index than smaller companies. The Nifty IT index is an important benchmark for investors interested in investing in the IT sector in India. It provides a broad view of the performance of the IT industry, which is a key sector of the Indian economy. The index is also a reference point for index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the IT sector in India.

The performance of the Nifty IT index is influenced by various factors, including the global trends in the IT industry, the demand for IT services and software, and the performance of individual companies. The index tends to be volatile, as it is sensitive to news and developments in the IT sector. For instance, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 had a significant impact on the IT industry, as many companies had to switch to remote work and adapt to new ways of working. As a result, the Nifty IT index experienced significant fluctuations during the pandemic.

It records the market performance of the Indian banks giving investors and market intermediaries a benchmark so they can evaluate properly before investing. The index constitutes a maximum of 12 companies listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and is computed through the free float market capitalization method. Investors or companies can use the Nifty Bank index for numerous purposes like benchmarking fund portfolios and launching index funds, ETFs and structured products. Though it was launched on September 15, 2003, Nifty Bank‚Äôs base value on the base date i.e, January 01, 2000, was set at 1000 and has given a CAGR of 24.61% in the first 10 years.

What are the eligibility criteria for the selection of constituent stocks under Nifty Bank?

At the time of review, companies should be a part of NIFTY 500. If the number of eligible stocks falls below 10, then according to NSE, the deficit number of stocks should be selected from the available stocks ranked within the top 800 based on daily average turnover and daily average full market capitalisation based on the data of previous six months which is used for index rebalancing of NIFTY 500. The company should be a part of the banking sector and its trading frequency needs to be at least 90% in the past six months. A listing history of six months is necessary for the company but if it comes out with an initial public offer (IPO) then it can be included in the index if it fulfils the eligibility criteria for three months instead of six. Only those companies can be a part of the index which are allowed to trade in the F&O segment. The final selection of all 12 companies is done based on the free-float market capitalization methodology by calculating the weightage of each company in the index in such a way that no stock weighs more than 33% and the top 3 stocks cumulatively should not be more than 62% during rebalancing. The index rebalancing is done on a semi-annual basis.

Who manages the Bank Nifty Index?

A professional team manages all the indices of NSE and follows a three-tier governance structure which includes the board of directors of NSE Indices Ltd, Index Advisory Committee (Equity) and the Index Maintenance Sub-Committee.

What is the Bank Nifty futures & options contract?

A forward contract trading on an exchange is called a futures contract. The Bank Nifty futures contracts are based on the Bank Nifty index. According to NSE, the maturity date of the contract, the underlying index and a market lot are some characteristics of the futures contract. These contracts are available for trading from the intro to the expiry date. Bank Nifty futures have a maximum of 3-month trading cycle - the near month (one), the next month (two) and the far month (three). A new contract is introduced on the trading day following the expiry of the near-month contract. The contracts expire on the last Thursday of the expiry month. If it is a trading holiday on the last Thursday, then contracts expire on the previous trading day."

The US stock market experienced a strong first half, with the Nasdaq Composite posting its best opening six months in four decades. The rally, driven by mega-cap technology shares, was driven by the excitement around AI software and central bank interest-rate hikes. The S&P 500 also surged 15.9% in H1 2023, with technology stocks driving most of the rally, while the DJIA fell behind.

In the second half, if history is any indication, stocks may benefit from their good start. According to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, the S&P 500 has increased by an average of 8% in the second half of the year since 1945, when it increased by at least 10% in the first half.

The US stock market‚Äôs bullish momentum in the first half could continue into the second half, as was seen in 1929 when the S&P 500 index climbed an average of 4.3% in the second half after rising at least 14% in the first six months. From October lows, the indices have rallied into the bull market, up by almost 20%. In October 2022, the market was trading at a 23% discount to a composite of Morningstar‚Äôs fundamental stock valuations, a level not seen since 2010.

Factors playing out in H2 are recession, interest rates, and the global economy. Although a recession is currently thought to be less likely to occur this year, economic worries still exist. A 71% risk of a recession in the coming 12 months was predicted by a New York Federal Reserve model of recession probability based on the Treasury yield curve earlier this month.

The second-largest economy in the world, China, announced second-quarter GDP growth of 6.3%, which was less than analysts had anticipated.

According to the International Monetary Fund, headline inflation appears to have peaked among the Group of 20 countries. Core inflation, however, continues to be significantly higher than the central banks‚Äô goal levels in the majority of G20 nations, especially the advanced economies.

Bull markets do not follow a straight line. Pullbacks, and possibly a correction, are to be expected in the second half. Since 1950, the average maximum downside for the S&P 500 during a calendar year has been minus 13.8%, which is significantly lower than this year‚Äôs current maximum drawdown of negative 7.8%.

Furthermore, historically, positive first-half S&P 500 gains have resulted in shorter second-half drawdowns. For example, the average second-half maximum drawdown after a positive first half is negative 9%, as opposed to an average drawdown of negative 13.1% when the first half was negative, according to data compiled by LPL Financial.

The technology industry has reached ‚Äúovervalued territory‚Äù in terms of valuation, and these megacap technology stocks ‚Äúhave already run their course.‚Äù Now is a good time to take a look at your portfolio and reallocate those assets that are overextended.

According to a theory put forth by Yale Hirsch of the Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac, the stock market exhibits a pattern that corresponds with a four-year presidential term. While typically the third year of a presidential cycle has seen the best performance of all four, the future for equities now appears even more promising."

The momentous event, much-awaited and steeped in rivalry, would culminate in a showdown ‚Äì India versus Pakistan ‚Äì on the grounds of Kandy, Sri Lanka, on September 2. As sworn adversaries, both teams found themselves positioned in Group A alongside Nepal, possibly entangling in a fierce match thrice within 15 days, provided they reach the Super 4 and ultimately, the finals.

The tournament‚Äôs commencement date is August 30, and it will run until September 17. This six-team ODI tournament serves as a precursor to the ICC World Cup and will kick off in Multan, with a Pakistan vs Nepal match.

After their opening match against their arch-rivals, led by Rohit Sharma, Team India will have a one-day break before facing Nepal on September 4 in Kandy. A brief interlude of one day would then lead them to another contest, this time against Nepal on September 4.

How India vs Pakistan may happen thrice

Asian Cricket Council (ACC) President Jay Shah confirmed that regardless of their positions after the first round, Pakistan will remain A1, and India will remain A2. In case either of them fails to qualify, Nepal will take their position. If both India and Pakistan manage to qualify, they are scheduled to face each other once more in Colombo on September 10.

In Group B, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are designated as B1 and B2, respectively. If any of these teams fail to advance to the Super 4s, Afghanistan will take their place.

In June, the Asian Cricket Council had already unveiled the schedule of the hybrid model Asia Cup, with four matches being held in Pakistan and the remaining nine in Sri Lanka.

Given the strained political ties between India and Pakistan over the last decade and a half, bilateral cricket has suffered, leading the neighbouring countries to compete only in multi-team events at neutral venues. The Indian board expressed safety concerns and ruled out travelling to Pakistan for the Asia Cup in September, prompting the PCB to offer India the option of playing their matches in the United Arab Emirates, thus adopting the ‚Äúhybrid model.‚Äù

The participating teams in the tournament are India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and Nepal, making it a total of 13 ODI matches.

This year‚Äôs format features two groups of three teams each, with the top two from each group advancing to the Super Four stage. The top two teams from the Super Four will then compete in the final on September 17. Should India and Pakistan secure the top spots, they will meet for the third time ‚Äî the finals ‚Äî in the tournament in Colombo.

The performance of the Nifty IT index is influenced by various factors, including the global trends in the IT industry, the demand for IT services and software, and the performance of individual companies.

Though it was launched on September 15, 2003, Nifty Bank‚Äôs base value on the base date i.e, January 01, 2000, was set at 1000 and has given a CAGR of 24.61% in the first 10 years.

What are the eligibility criteria for the selection of constituent stocks under Nifty Bank?

At the time of review, companies should be a part of NIFTY 500. If the number of eligible stocks falls below 10, then according to NSE, the deficit number of stocks should be selected from the available stocks ranked within the top 800 based on daily average turnover and daily average full market capitalisation based on the data of previous six months which is used for index rebalancing of NIFTY 500. The company should be a part of the banking sector and its trading frequency needs to be at least 90% in the past six months. A listing history of six months is necessary for the company but if it comes out with an initial public offer (IPO) then it can be included in the index if it fulfils the eligibility criteria for three months instead of six. Only those companies can be a part of the index which are allowed to trade in the F&O segment. The final selection of all 12 companies is done based on the free-float market capitalization methodology by calculating the weightage of each company in the index in such a way that no stock weighs more than 33% and the top 3 stocks cumulatively should not be more than 62% during rebalancing. The index rebalancing is done on a semi-annual basis.

Who manages the Bank Nifty Index?

A professional team manages all the indices of NSE and follows a three-tier governance structure which includes the board of directors of NSE Indices Ltd, Index Advisory Committee (Equity) and the Index Maintenance Sub-Committee.

What is the Bank Nifty futures & options contract?

A forward contract trading on an exchange is called a futures contract. The Bank Nifty futures contracts are based on the Bank Nifty index. According to NSE, the maturity date of the contract, the underlying index and a market lot are some characteristics of the futures contract. These contracts are available for trading from the intro to the expiry date. Bank Nifty futures have a maximum of 3-month trading cycle - the near month (one), the next month (two) and the far month (three). A new contract is introduced on the trading day following the expiry of the near-month contract. The contracts expire on the last Thursday of the expiry month. If it is a trading holiday on the last Thursday, then contracts expire on the previous trading day."

The US stock market experienced a strong first half, with the Nasdaq Composite posting its best opening six months in four decades. The rally, driven by mega-cap technology shares, was driven by the excitement around AI software and central bank interest-rate hikes. The S&P 500 also surged 15.9% in H1 2023, with technology stocks driving most of the rally, while the DJIA fell behind.

In the second half, if history is any indication, stocks may benefit from their good start. According to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, the S&P 500 has increased by an average of 8% in the second half of the year since 1945, when it increased by at least 10% in the first half.

The US stock market‚Äôs bullish momentum in the first half could continue into the second half, as was seen in 1929 when the S&P 500 index climbed an average of 4.3% in the second half after rising at least 14% in the first six months. From October lows, the indices have rallied into the bull market, up by almost 20%. In October 2022, the market was trading at a 23% discount to a composite of Morningstar‚Äôs fundamental stock valuations, a level not seen since 2010.

Factors playing out in H2 are recession, interest rates, and the global economy. Although a recession is currently thought to be less likely to occur this year, economic worries still exist. A 71% risk of a recession in the coming 12 months was predicted by a New York Federal Reserve model of recession probability based on the Treasury yield curve earlier this month.

The second-largest economy in the world, China, announced second-quarter GDP growth of 6.3%, which was less than analysts had anticipated.

According to the International Monetary Fund, headline inflation appears to have peaked among the Group of 20 countries. Core inflation, however, continues to be significantly higher than the central banks‚Äô goal levels in the majority of G20 nations, especially the advanced economies.

Bull markets do not follow a straight line. Pullbacks, and possibly a correction, are to be expected in the second half. Since 1950, the average maximum downside for the S&P 500 during a calendar year has been minus 13.8%, which is significantly lower than this year‚Äôs current maximum drawdown of negative 7.8%.

Furthermore, historically, positive first-half S&P 500 gains have resulted in shorter second-half drawdowns. For example, the average second-half maximum drawdown after a positive first half is negative 9%, as opposed to an average drawdown of negative 13.1% when the first half was negative, according to data compiled by LPL Financial.

The technology industry has reached ‚Äúovervalued territory‚Äù in terms of valuation, and these megacap technology stocks ‚Äúhave already run their course.‚Äù Now is a good time to take a look at your portfolio and reallocate those assets that are overextended.

According to a theory put forth by Yale Hirsch of the Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac, the stock market exhibits a pattern that corresponds with a four-year presidential term. While typically the third year of a presidential cycle has seen the best performance of all four, the future for equities now appears even more promising."

The momentous event, much-awaited and steeped in rivalry, would culminate in a showdown ‚Äì India versus Pakistan ‚Äì on the grounds of Kandy, Sri Lanka, on September 2. As sworn adversaries, both teams found themselves positioned in Group A alongside Nepal, possibly entangling in a fierce match thrice within 15 days, provided they reach the Super 4 and ultimately, the finals.

The tournament‚Äôs commencement date is August 30, and it will run until September 17. This six-team ODI tournament serves as a precursor to the ICC World Cup and will kick off in Multan, with a Pakistan vs Nepal match.

After their opening match against their arch-rivals, led by Rohit Sharma, Team India will have a one-day break before facing Nepal on September 4 in Kandy. A brief interlude of one day would then lead them to another contest, this time against Nepal on September 4.

How India vs Pakistan may happen thrice

Asian Cricket Council (ACC) President Jay Shah confirmed that regardless of their positions after the first round, Pakistan will remain A1, and India will remain A2. In case either of them fails to qualify, Nepal will take their position. If both India and Pakistan manage to qualify, they are scheduled to face each other once more in Colombo on September 10.

In Group B, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are designated as B1 and B2, respectively. If any of these teams fail to advance to the Super 4s, Afghanistan will take their place.

In June, the Asian Cricket Council had already unveiled the schedule of the hybrid model Asia Cup, with four matches being held in Pakistan and the remaining nine in Sri Lanka.

Given the strained political ties between India and Pakistan over the last decade and a half, bilateral cricket has suffered, leading the neighbouring countries to compete only in multi-team events at neutral venues. The Indian board expressed safety concerns and ruled out travelling to Pakistan for the Asia Cup in September, prompting the PCB to offer India the option of playing their matches in the United Arab Emirates, thus adopting the ‚Äúhybrid model.‚Äù

The participating teams in the tournament are India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and Nepal, making it a total of 13 ODI matches.

This year‚Äôs format features two groups of three teams each, with the top two from each group advancing to the Super Four stage. The top two teams from the Super Four will then compete in the final on September 17. Should India and Pakistan secure the top spots, they will meet for the third time ‚Äî the finals ‚Äî in the tournament in Colombo.

In the short term, the index is expected to stay positive. However, if it fails to surpass the 20,000 level, investors might engage in profit-taking.

Financials, FMCG & Healthcare stocks fired up Nifty, Sensex today

‚ÄúFinancials, FMCG & Healthcare fired up benchmark indices today which closed just shy of the magical 20k on the Nifty. FII‚Äôs have pulled off a 700-point rally in the Nifty since the 3rd of this month at the start of the earnings season for the first quarter,‚Äù said S Ranganathan, Head of Research at LKP securities.

Q1 results, FII inflow providing extra boost to Nifty, Sensex

‚ÄúUnlocking of value by heavyweights (like RIL & ITC) is apprising the main indices. The anticipation of good Q1 results from Banks, is providing an extra boost to drive to new highs. Mixed cues from global peers are not disturbing the mood of the domestic market as FIIs inflows stay put to the prospects of the Indian economy,‚Äù said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.

Investors might book profit if Nifty fails to surpass 20,000

‚ÄúNifty 50 remains above the critical moving average, indicating a positive trend. Furthermore, the RSI shows a bullish crossover, suggesting potential market strength. In the short term, the index is expected to stay positive. However, if it fails to surpass the 20,000 level, investors might engage in profit-taking. There is a support level of 19,800, which could attract buying interest during potential pullbacks,‚Äù said Rupak De, Senior Technical analyst at LKP Securities.

Bank Nifty support at 45500; resistance at 46400-46500

‚ÄúBank Nifty successfully surpassed the key resistance level of 46000, indicating a continuation of the upward momentum. The index is characterized by a series of ‚Äúhigher high and higher low formations,‚Äù which is a bullish pattern that confirms the strength of the uptrend. The support level for the index is at 45500, and as long as this level remains intact on a closing basis, the overall trend remains bullish. On the upside, the next immediate hurdle is placed at the 46400-46500 zone,‚Äù said Kunal Shah, Senior Technical & Derivative analyst at LKP Securities."

It is a subset of the Nifty 50 index, representing the top 50 companies listed on India's National Stock Exchange (NSE). The Nifty IT index comprises the top 10 IT companies listed on the NSE, based on their market capitalisation. These companies are among the largest IT services and software providers in India, and some of them are also global players in their respective domains.

The Nifty IT index is a market capitalization-weighted index, which means that the weightage of each company in the index is proportional to its market capitalization. This implies that the performance of larger companies has a greater impact on the index than smaller companies. The Nifty IT index is an important benchmark for investors interested in investing in the IT sector in India. It provides a broad view of the performance of the IT industry, which is a key sector of the Indian economy. The index is also a reference point for index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the IT sector in India.

The performance of the Nifty IT index is influenced by various factors, including the global trends in the IT industry, the demand for IT services and software, and the performance of individual companies. The index tends to be volatile, as it is sensitive to news and developments in the IT sector. For instance, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 had a significant impact on the IT industry, as many companies had to switch to remote work and adapt to new ways of working. As a result, the Nifty IT index experienced significant fluctuations during the pandemic.

It records the market performance of the Indian banks giving investors and market intermediaries a benchmark so they can evaluate properly before investing. The index constitutes a maximum of 12 companies listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and is computed through the free float market capitalization method. Investors or companies can use the Nifty Bank index for numerous purposes like benchmarking fund portfolios and launching index funds, ETFs and structured products. Though it was launched on September 15, 2003, Nifty Bank‚Äôs base value on the base date i.e, January 01, 2000, was set at 1000 and has given a CAGR of 24.61% in the first 10 years.

What are the eligibility criteria for the selection of constituent stocks under Nifty Bank?

At the time of review, companies should be a part of NIFTY 500. If the number of eligible stocks falls below 10, then according to NSE, the deficit number of stocks should be selected from the available stocks ranked within the top 800 based on daily average turnover and daily average full market capitalisation based on the data of previous six months which is used for index rebalancing of NIFTY 500. The company should be a part of the banking sector and its trading frequency needs to be at least 90% in the past six months. A listing history of six months is necessary for the company but if it comes out with an initial public offer (IPO) then it can be included in the index if it fulfils the eligibility criteria for three months instead of six. Only those companies can be a part of the index which are allowed to trade in the F&O segment. The final selection of all 12 companies is done based on the free-float market capitalization methodology by calculating the weightage of each company in the index in such a way that no stock weighs more than 33% and the top 3 stocks cumulatively should not be more than 62% during rebalancing. The index rebalancing is done on a semi-annual basis.

Who manages the Bank Nifty Index?

A professional team manages all the indices of NSE and follows a three-tier governance structure which includes the board of directors of NSE Indices Ltd, Index Advisory Committee (Equity) and the Index Maintenance Sub-Committee.

What is the Bank Nifty futures & options contract?

A forward contract trading on an exchange is called a futures contract. The Bank Nifty futures contracts are based on the Bank Nifty index. According to NSE, the maturity date of the contract, the underlying index and a market lot are some characteristics of the futures contract. These contracts are available for trading from the intro to the expiry date. Bank Nifty futures have a maximum of 3-month trading cycle - the near month (one), the next month (two) and the far month (three). A new contract is introduced on the trading day following the expiry of the near-month contract. The contracts expire on the last Thursday of the expiry month. If it is a trading holiday on the last Thursday, then contracts expire on the previous trading day."

The US stock market experienced a strong first half, with the Nasdaq Composite posting its best opening six months in four decades. The rally, driven by mega-cap technology shares, was driven by the excitement around AI software and central bank interest-rate hikes. The S&P 500 also surged 15.9% in H1 2023, with technology stocks driving most of the rally, while the DJIA fell behind.

In the second half, if history is any indication, stocks may benefit from their good start. According to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, the S&P 500 has increased by an average of 8% in the second half of the year since 1945, when it increased by at least 10% in the first half.

The US stock market‚Äôs bullish momentum in the first half could continue into the second half, as was seen in 1929 when the S&P 500 index climbed an average of 4.3% in the second half after rising at least 14% in the first six months. From October lows, the indices have rallied into the bull market, up by almost 20%. In October 2022, the market was trading at a 23% discount to a composite of Morningstar‚Äôs fundamental stock valuations, a level not seen since 2010.

Factors playing out in H2 are recession, interest rates, and the global economy. Although a recession is currently thought to be less likely to occur this year, economic worries still exist. A 71% risk of a recession in the coming 12 months was predicted by a New York Federal Reserve model of recession probability based on the Treasury yield curve earlier this month.

The second-largest economy in the world, China, announced second-quarter GDP growth of 6.3%, which was less than analysts had anticipated.

According to the International Monetary Fund, headline inflation appears to have peaked among the Group of 20 countries. Core inflation, however, continues to be significantly higher than the central banks‚Äô goal levels in the majority of G20 nations, especially the advanced economies.

Bull markets do not follow a straight line. Pullbacks, and possibly a correction, are to be expected in the second half. Since 1950, the average maximum downside for the S&P 500 during a calendar year has been minus 13.8%, which is significantly lower than this year‚Äôs current maximum drawdown of negative 7.8%.

Furthermore, historically, positive first-half S&P 500 gains have resulted in shorter second-half drawdowns. For example, the average second-half maximum drawdown after a positive first half is negative 9%, as opposed to an average drawdown of negative 13.1% when the first half was negative, according to data compiled by LPL Financial.

The technology industry has reached ‚Äúovervalued territory‚Äù in terms of valuation, and these megacap technology stocks ‚Äúhave already run their course.‚Äù Now is a good time to take a look at your portfolio and reallocate those assets that are overextended.

According to a theory put forth by Yale Hirsch of the Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac, the stock market exhibits a pattern that corresponds with a four-year presidential term. While typically the third year of a presidential cycle has seen the best performance of all four, the future for equities now appears even more promising."

The momentous event, much-awaited and steeped in rivalry, would culminate in a showdown ‚Äì India versus Pakistan ‚Äì on the grounds of Kandy, Sri Lanka, on September 2. As sworn adversaries, both teams found themselves positioned in Group A alongside Nepal, possibly entangling in a fierce match thrice within 15 days, provided they reach the Super 4 and ultimately, the finals.

The tournament‚Äôs commencement date is August 30, and it will run until September 17. This six-team ODI tournament serves as a precursor to the ICC World Cup and will kick off in Multan, with a Pakistan vs Nepal match.

After their opening match against their arch-rivals, led by Rohit Sharma, Team India will have a one-day break before facing Nepal on September 4 in Kandy. A brief interlude of one day would then lead them to another contest, this time against Nepal on September 4.

How India vs Pakistan may happen thrice

Asian Cricket Council (ACC) President Jay Shah confirmed that regardless of their positions after the first round, Pakistan will remain A1, and India will remain A2. In case either of them fails to qualify, Nepal will take their position. If both India and Pakistan manage to qualify, they are scheduled to face each other once more in Colombo on September 10.

In Group B, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are designated as B1 and B2, respectively. If any of these teams fail to advance to the Super 4s, Afghanistan will take their place.

In June, the Asian Cricket Council had already unveiled the schedule of the hybrid model Asia Cup, with four matches being held in Pakistan and the remaining nine in Sri Lanka.

Given the strained political ties between India and Pakistan over the last decade and a half, bilateral cricket has suffered, leading the neighbouring countries to compete only in multi-team events at neutral venues. The Indian board expressed safety concerns and ruled out travelling to Pakistan for the Asia Cup in September, prompting the PCB to offer India the option of playing their matches in the United Arab Emirates, thus adopting the ‚Äúhybrid model.‚Äù

The participating teams in the tournament are India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and Nepal, making it a total of 13 ODI matches.

This year‚Äôs format features two groups of three teams each, with the top two from each group advancing to the Super Four stage. The top two teams from the Super Four will then compete in the final on September 17. Should India and Pakistan secure the top spots, they will meet for the third time ‚Äî the finals ‚Äî in the tournament in Colombo.

The performance of the Nifty IT index is influenced by various factors, including the global trends in the IT industry, the demand for IT services and software, and the performance of individual companies.

Though it was launched on September 15, 2003, Nifty Bank‚Äôs base value on the base date i.e, January 01, 2000, was set at 1000 and has given a CAGR of 24.61% in the first 10 years.

What are the eligibility criteria for the selection of constituent stocks under Nifty Bank?

At the time of review, companies should be a part of NIFTY 500. If the number of eligible stocks falls below 10, then according to NSE, the deficit number of stocks should be selected from the available stocks ranked within the top 800 based on daily average turnover and daily average full market capitalisation based on the data of previous six months which is used for index rebalancing of NIFTY 500. The company should be a part of the banking sector and its trading frequency needs to be at least 90% in the past six months. A listing history of six months is necessary for the company but if it comes out with an initial public offer (IPO) then it can be included in the index if it fulfils the eligibility criteria for three months instead of six. Only those companies can be a part of the index which are allowed to trade in the F&O segment. The final selection of all 12 companies is done based on the free-float market capitalization methodology by calculating the weightage of each company in the index in such a way that no stock weighs more than 33% and the top 3 stocks cumulatively should not be more than 62% during rebalancing. The index rebalancing is done on a semi-annual basis.

Who manages the Bank Nifty Index?

A professional team manages all the indices of NSE and follows a three-tier governance structure which includes the board of directors of NSE Indices Ltd, Index Advisory Committee (Equity) and the Index Maintenance Sub-Committee.

What is the Bank Nifty futures & options contract?

A forward contract trading on an exchange is called a futures contract. The Bank Nifty futures contracts are based on the Bank Nifty index. According to NSE, the maturity date of the contract, the underlying index and a market lot are some characteristics of the futures contract. These contracts are available for trading from the intro to the expiry date. Bank Nifty futures have a maximum of 3-month trading cycle - the near month (one), the next month (two) and the far month (three). A new contract is introduced on the trading day following the expiry of the near-month contract. The contracts expire on the last Thursday of the expiry month. If it is a trading holiday on the last Thursday, then contracts expire on the previous trading day."

The US stock market experienced a strong first half, with the Nasdaq Composite posting its best opening six months in four decades. The rally, driven by mega-cap technology shares, was driven by the excitement around AI software and central bank interest-rate hikes. The S&P 500 also surged 15.9% in H1 2023, with technology stocks driving most of the rally, while the DJIA fell behind.

In the second half, if history is any indication, stocks may benefit from their good start. According to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, the S&P 500 has increased by an average of 8% in the second half of the year since 1945, when it increased by at least 10% in the first half.

The US stock market‚Äôs bullish momentum in the first half could continue into the second half, as was seen in 1929 when the S&P 500 index climbed an average of 4.3% in the second half after rising at least 14% in the first six months. From October lows, the indices have rallied into the bull market, up by almost 20%. In October 2022, the market was trading at a 23% discount to a composite of Morningstar‚Äôs fundamental stock valuations, a level not seen since 2010.

Factors playing out in H2 are recession, interest rates, and the global economy. Although a recession is currently thought to be less likely to occur this year, economic worries still exist. A 71% risk of a recession in the coming 12 months was predicted by a New York Federal Reserve model of recession probability based on the Treasury yield curve earlier this month.

The second-largest economy in the world, China, announced second-quarter GDP growth of 6.3%, which was less than analysts had anticipated.

According to the International Monetary Fund, headline inflation appears to have peaked among the Group of 20 countries. Core inflation, however, continues to be significantly higher than the central banks‚Äô goal levels in the majority of G20 nations, especially the advanced economies.

Bull markets do not follow a straight line. Pullbacks, and possibly a correction, are to be expected in the second half. Since 1950, the average maximum downside for the S&P 500 during a calendar year has been minus 13.8%, which is significantly lower than this year‚Äôs current maximum drawdown of negative 7.8%.

Furthermore, historically, positive first-half S&P 500 gains have resulted in shorter second-half drawdowns. For example, the average second-half maximum drawdown after a positive first half is negative 9%, as opposed to an average drawdown of negative 13.1% when the first half was negative, according to data compiled by LPL Financial.

The technology industry has reached ‚Äúovervalued territory‚Äù in terms of valuation, and these megacap technology stocks ‚Äúhave already run their course.‚Äù Now is a good time to take a look at your portfolio and reallocate those assets that are overextended.

According to a theory put forth by Yale Hirsch of the Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac, the stock market exhibits a pattern that corresponds with a four-year presidential term. While typically the third year of a presidential cycle has seen the best performance of all four, the future for equities now appears even more promising."

The momentous event, much-awaited and steeped in rivalry, would culminate in a showdown ‚Äì India versus Pakistan ‚Äì on the grounds of Kandy, Sri Lanka, on September 2. As sworn adversaries, both teams found themselves positioned in Group A alongside Nepal, possibly entangling in a fierce match thrice within 15 days, provided they reach the Super 4 and ultimately, the finals.

The tournament‚Äôs commencement date is August 30, and it will run until September 17. This six-team ODI tournament serves as a precursor to the ICC World Cup and will kick off in Multan, with a Pakistan vs Nepal match.

After their opening match against their arch-rivals, led by Rohit Sharma, Team India will have a one-day break before facing Nepal on September 4 in Kandy. A brief interlude of one day would then lead them to another contest, this time against Nepal on September 4.

How India vs Pakistan may happen thrice

Asian Cricket Council (ACC) President Jay Shah confirmed that regardless of their positions after the first round, Pakistan will remain A1, and India will remain A2. In case either of them fails to qualify, Nepal will take their position. If both India and Pakistan manage to qualify, they are scheduled to face each other once more in Colombo on September 10.

In Group B, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are designated as B1 and B2, respectively. If any of these teams fail to advance to the Super 4s, Afghanistan will take their place.

In June, the Asian Cricket Council had already unveiled the schedule of the hybrid model Asia Cup, with four matches being held in Pakistan and the remaining nine in Sri Lanka.

Given the strained political ties between India and Pakistan over the last decade and a half, bilateral cricket has suffered, leading the neighbouring countries to compete only in multi-team events at neutral venues. The Indian board expressed safety concerns and ruled out travelling to Pakistan for the Asia Cup in September, prompting the PCB to offer India the option of playing their matches in the United Arab Emirates, thus adopting the ‚Äúhybrid model.‚Äù

The participating teams in the tournament are India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and Nepal, making it a total of 13 ODI matches.

This year‚Äôs format features two groups of three teams each, with the top two from each group advancing to the Super Four stage. The top two teams from the Super Four will then compete in the final on September 17. Should India and Pakistan secure the top spots, they will meet for the third time ‚Äî the finals ‚Äî in the tournament in Colombo.

In the short term, the index is expected to stay positive. However, if it fails to surpass the 20,000 level, investors might engage in profit-taking.

Financials, FMCG & Healthcare stocks fired up Nifty, Sensex today

‚ÄúFinancials, FMCG & Healthcare fired up benchmark indices today which closed just shy of the magical 20k on the Nifty. FII‚Äôs have pulled off a 700-point rally in the Nifty since the 3rd of this month at the start of the earnings season for the first quarter,‚Äù said S Ranganathan, Head of Research at LKP securities.

Q1 results, FII inflow providing extra boost to Nifty, Sensex

‚ÄúUnlocking of value by heavyweights (like RIL & ITC) is apprising the main indices. The anticipation of good Q1 results from Banks, is providing an extra boost to drive to new highs. Mixed cues from global peers are not disturbing the mood of the domestic market as FIIs inflows stay put to the prospects of the Indian economy,‚Äù said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.

Investors might book profit if Nifty fails to surpass 20,000

‚ÄúNifty 50 remains above the critical moving average, indicating a positive trend. Furthermore, the RSI shows a bullish crossover, suggesting potential market strength. In the short term, the index is expected to stay positive. However, if it fails to surpass the 20,000 level, investors might engage in profit-taking. There is a support level of 19,800, which could attract buying interest during potential pullbacks,‚Äù said Rupak De, Senior Technical analyst at LKP Securities.

Bank Nifty support at 45500; resistance at 46400-46500

‚ÄúBank Nifty successfully surpassed the key resistance level of 46000, indicating a continuation of the upward momentum. The index is characterized by a series of ‚Äúhigher high and higher low formations,‚Äù which is a bullish pattern that confirms the strength of the uptrend. The support level for the index is at 45500, and as long as this level remains intact on a closing basis, the overall trend remains bullish. On the upside, the next immediate hurdle is placed at the 46400-46500 zone,‚Äù said Kunal Shah, Senior Technical & Derivative analyst at LKP Securities."

It is a subset of the Nifty 50 index, representing the top 50 companies listed on India's National Stock Exchange (NSE). The Nifty IT index comprises the top 10 IT companies listed on the NSE, based on their market capitalisation. These companies are among the largest IT services and software providers in India, and some of them are also global players in their respective domains.

The Nifty IT index is a market capitalization-weighted index, which means that the weightage of each company in the index is proportional to its market capitalization. This implies that the performance of larger companies has a greater impact on the index than smaller companies. The Nifty IT index is an important benchmark for investors interested in investing in the IT sector in India. It provides a broad view of the performance of the IT industry, which is a key sector of the Indian economy. The index is also a reference point for index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the IT sector in India.

The performance of the Nifty IT index is influenced by various factors, including the global trends in the IT industry, the demand for IT services and software, and the performance of individual companies. The index tends to be volatile, as it is sensitive to news and developments in the IT sector. For instance, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 had a significant impact on the IT industry, as many companies had to switch to remote work and adapt to new ways of working. As a result, the Nifty IT index experienced significant fluctuations during the pandemic.

It records the market performance of the Indian banks giving investors and market intermediaries a benchmark so they can evaluate properly before investing. The index constitutes a maximum of 12 companies listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and is computed through the free float market capitalization method. Investors or companies can use the Nifty Bank index for numerous purposes like benchmarking fund portfolios and launching index funds, ETFs and structured products. Though it was launched on September 15, 2003, Nifty Bank‚Äôs base value on the base date i.e, January 01, 2000, was set at 1000 and has given a CAGR of 24.61% in the first 10 years.

What are the eligibility criteria for the selection of constituent stocks under Nifty Bank?

At the time of review, companies should be a part of NIFTY 500. If the number of eligible stocks falls below 10, then according to NSE, the deficit number of stocks should be selected from the available stocks ranked within the top 800 based on daily average turnover and daily average full market capitalisation based on the data of previous six months which is used for index rebalancing of NIFTY 500. The company should be a part of the banking sector and its trading frequency needs to be at least 90% in the past six months. A listing history of six months is necessary for the company but if it comes out with an initial public offer (IPO) then it can be included in the index if it fulfils the eligibility criteria for three months instead of six. Only those companies can be a part of the index which are allowed to trade in the F&O segment. The final selection of all 12 companies is done based on the free-float market capitalization methodology by calculating the weightage of each company in the index in such a way that no stock weighs more than 33% and the top 3 stocks cumulatively should not be more than 62% during rebalancing. The index rebalancing is done on a semi-annual basis.

Who manages the Bank Nifty Index?

A professional team manages all the indices of NSE and follows a three-tier governance structure which includes the board of directors of NSE Indices Ltd, Index Advisory Committee (Equity) and the Index Maintenance Sub-Committee.

What is the Bank Nifty futures & options contract?

A forward contract trading on an exchange is called a futures contract. The Bank Nifty futures contracts are based on the Bank Nifty index. According to NSE, the maturity date of the contract, the underlying index and a market lot are some characteristics of the futures contract. These contracts are available for trading from the intro to the expiry date. Bank Nifty futures have a maximum of 3-month trading cycle - the near month (one), the next month (two) and the far month (three). A new contract is introduced on the trading day following the expiry of the near-month contract. The contracts expire on the last Thursday of the expiry month. If it is a trading holiday on the last Thursday, then contracts expire on the previous trading day."

The US stock market experienced a strong first half, with the Nasdaq Composite posting its best opening six months in four decades. The rally, driven by mega-cap technology shares, was driven by the excitement around AI software and central bank interest-rate hikes. The S&P 500 also surged 15.9% in H1 2023, with technology stocks driving most of the rally, while the DJIA fell behind.

In the second half, if history is any indication, stocks may benefit from their good start. According to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, the S&P 500 has increased by an average of 8% in the second half of the year since 1945, when it increased by at least 10% in the first half.

The US stock market‚Äôs bullish momentum in the first half could continue into the second half, as was seen in 1929 when the S&P 500 index climbed an average of 4.3% in the second half after rising at least 14% in the first six months. From October lows, the indices have rallied into the bull market, up by almost 20%. In October 2022, the market was trading at a 23% discount to a composite of Morningstar‚Äôs fundamental stock valuations, a level not seen since 2010.

Factors playing out in H2 are recession, interest rates, and the global economy. Although a recession is currently thought to be less likely to occur this year, economic worries still exist. A 71% risk of a recession in the coming 12 months was predicted by a New York Federal Reserve model of recession probability based on the Treasury yield curve earlier this month.

The second-largest economy in the world, China, announced second-quarter GDP growth of 6.3%, which was less than analysts had anticipated.

According to the International Monetary Fund, headline inflation appears to have peaked among the Group of 20 countries. Core inflation, however, continues to be significantly higher than the central banks‚Äô goal levels in the majority of G20 nations, especially the advanced economies.

Bull markets do not follow a straight line. Pullbacks, and possibly a correction, are to be expected in the second half. Since 1950, the average maximum downside for the S&P 500 during a calendar year has been minus 13.8%, which is significantly lower than this year‚Äôs current maximum drawdown of negative 7.8%.

Furthermore, historically, positive first-half S&P 500 gains have resulted in shorter second-half drawdowns. For example, the average second-half maximum drawdown after a positive first half is negative 9%, as opposed to an average drawdown of negative 13.1% when the first half was negative, according to data compiled by LPL Financial.

The technology industry has reached ‚Äúovervalued territory‚Äù in terms of valuation, and these megacap technology stocks ‚Äúhave already run their course.‚Äù Now is a good time to take a look at your portfolio and reallocate those assets that are overextended.

According to a theory put forth by Yale Hirsch of the Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac, the stock market exhibits a pattern that corresponds with a four-year presidential term. While typically the third year of a presidential cycle has seen the best performance of all four, the future for equities now appears even more promising."

The momentous event, much-awaited and steeped in rivalry, would culminate in a showdown ‚Äì India versus Pakistan ‚Äì on the grounds of Kandy, Sri Lanka, on September 2. As sworn adversaries, both teams found themselves positioned in Group A alongside Nepal, possibly entangling in a fierce match thrice within 15 days, provided they reach the Super 4 and ultimately, the finals.

The tournament‚Äôs commencement date is August 30, and it will run until September 17. This six-team ODI tournament serves as a precursor to the ICC World Cup and will kick off in Multan, with a Pakistan vs Nepal match.

After their opening match against their arch-rivals, led by Rohit Sharma, Team India will have a one-day break before facing Nepal on September 4 in Kandy. A brief interlude of one day would then lead them to another contest, this time against Nepal on September 4.

How India vs Pakistan may happen thrice

Asian Cricket Council (ACC) President Jay Shah confirmed that regardless of their positions after the first round, Pakistan will remain A1, and India will remain A2. In case either of them fails to qualify, Nepal will take their position. If both India and Pakistan manage to qualify, they are scheduled to face each other once more in Colombo on September 10.

In Group B, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are designated as B1 and B2, respectively. If any of these teams fail to advance to the Super 4s, Afghanistan will take their place.

In June, the Asian Cricket Council had already unveiled the schedule of the hybrid model Asia Cup, with four matches being held in Pakistan and the remaining nine in Sri Lanka.

Given the strained political ties between India and Pakistan over the last decade and a half, bilateral cricket has suffered, leading the neighbouring countries to compete only in multi-team events at neutral venues. The Indian board expressed safety concerns and ruled out travelling to Pakistan for the Asia Cup in September, prompting the PCB to offer India the option of playing their matches in the United Arab Emirates, thus adopting the ‚Äúhybrid model.‚Äù

The participating teams in the tournament are India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and Nepal, making it a total of 13 ODI matches.

This year‚Äôs format features two groups of three teams each, with the top two from each group advancing to the Super Four stage. The top two teams from the Super Four will then compete in the final on September 17. Should India and Pakistan secure the top spots, they will meet for the third time ‚Äî the finals ‚Äî in the tournament in Colombo.

The performance of the Nifty IT index is influenced by various factors, including the global trends in the IT industry, the demand for IT services and software, and the performance of individual companies.

Though it was launched on September 15, 2003, Nifty Bank‚Äôs base value on the base date i.e, January 01, 2000, was set at 1000 and has given a CAGR of 24.61% in the first 10 years.

What are the eligibility criteria for the selection of constituent stocks under Nifty Bank?

At the time of review, companies should be a part of NIFTY 500. If the number of eligible stocks falls below 10, then according to NSE, the deficit number of stocks should be selected from the available stocks ranked within the top 800 based on daily average turnover and daily average full market capitalisation based on the data of previous six months which is used for index rebalancing of NIFTY 500. The company should be a part of the banking sector and its trading frequency needs to be at least 90% in the past six months. A listing history of six months is necessary for the company but if it comes out with an initial public offer (IPO) then it can be included in the index if it fulfils the eligibility criteria for three months instead of six. Only those companies can be a part of the index which are allowed to trade in the F&O segment. The final selection of all 12 companies is done based on the free-float market capitalization methodology by calculating the weightage of each company in the index in such a way that no stock weighs more than 33% and the top 3 stocks cumulatively should not be more than 62% during rebalancing. The index rebalancing is done on a semi-annual basis.

Who manages the Bank Nifty Index?

A professional team manages all the indices of NSE and follows a three-tier governance structure which includes the board of directors of NSE Indices Ltd, Index Advisory Committee (Equity) and the Index Maintenance Sub-Committee.

What is the Bank Nifty futures & options contract?

A forward contract trading on an exchange is called a futures contract. The Bank Nifty futures contracts are based on the Bank Nifty index. According to NSE, the maturity date of the contract, the underlying index and a market lot are some characteristics of the futures contract. These contracts are available for trading from the intro to the expiry date. Bank Nifty futures have a maximum of 3-month trading cycle - the near month (one), the next month (two) and the far month (three). A new contract is introduced on the trading day following the expiry of the near-month contract. The contracts expire on the last Thursday of the expiry month. If it is a trading holiday on the last Thursday, then contracts expire on the previous trading day."

The US stock market experienced a strong first half, with the Nasdaq Composite posting its best opening six months in four decades. The rally, driven by mega-cap technology shares, was driven by the excitement around AI software and central bank interest-rate hikes. The S&P 500 also surged 15.9% in H1 2023, with technology stocks driving most of the rally, while the DJIA fell behind.

In the second half, if history is any indication, stocks may benefit from their good start. According to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, the S&P 500 has increased by an average of 8% in the second half of the year since 1945, when it increased by at least 10% in the first half.

The US stock market‚Äôs bullish momentum in the first half could continue into the second half, as was seen in 1929 when the S&P 500 index climbed an average of 4.3% in the second half after rising at least 14% in the first six months. From October lows, the indices have rallied into the bull market, up by almost 20%. In October 2022, the market was trading at a 23% discount to a composite of Morningstar‚Äôs fundamental stock valuations, a level not seen since 2010.

Factors playing out in H2 are recession, interest rates, and the global economy. Although a recession is currently thought to be less likely to occur this year, economic worries still exist. A 71% risk of a recession in the coming 12 months was predicted by a New York Federal Reserve model of recession probability based on the Treasury yield curve earlier this month.

The second-largest economy in the world, China, announced second-quarter GDP growth of 6.3%, which was less than analysts had anticipated.

According to the International Monetary Fund, headline inflation appears to have peaked among the Group of 20 countries. Core inflation, however, continues to be significantly higher than the central banks‚Äô goal levels in the majority of G20 nations, especially the advanced economies.

Bull markets do not follow a straight line. Pullbacks, and possibly a correction, are to be expected in the second half. Since 1950, the average maximum downside for the S&P 500 during a calendar year has been minus 13.8%, which is significantly lower than this year‚Äôs current maximum drawdown of negative 7.8%.

Furthermore, historically, positive first-half S&P 500 gains have resulted in shorter second-half drawdowns. For example, the average second-half maximum drawdown after a positive first half is negative 9%, as opposed to an average drawdown of negative 13.1% when the first half was negative, according to data compiled by LPL Financial.

The technology industry has reached ‚Äúovervalued territory‚Äù in terms of valuation, and these megacap technology stocks ‚Äúhave already run their course.‚Äù Now is a good time to take a look at your portfolio and reallocate those assets that are overextended.

According to a theory put forth by Yale Hirsch of the Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac, the stock market exhibits a pattern that corresponds with a four-year presidential term. While typically the third year of a presidential cycle has seen the best performance of all four, the future for equities now appears even more promising."

The momentous event, much-awaited and steeped in rivalry, would culminate in a showdown ‚Äì India versus Pakistan ‚Äì on the grounds of Kandy, Sri Lanka, on September 2. As sworn adversaries, both teams found themselves positioned in Group A alongside Nepal, possibly entangling in a fierce match thrice within 15 days, provided they reach the Super 4 and ultimately, the finals.

The tournament‚Äôs commencement date is August 30, and it will run until September 17. This six-team ODI tournament serves as a precursor to the ICC World Cup and will kick off in Multan, with a Pakistan vs Nepal match.

After their opening match against their arch-rivals, led by Rohit Sharma, Team India will have a one-day break before facing Nepal on September 4 in Kandy. A brief interlude of one day would then lead them to another contest, this time against Nepal on September 4.

How India vs Pakistan may happen thrice

Asian Cricket Council (ACC) President Jay Shah confirmed that regardless of their positions after the first round, Pakistan will remain A1, and India will remain A2. In case either of them fails to qualify, Nepal will take their position. If both India and Pakistan manage to qualify, they are scheduled to face each other once more in Colombo on September 10.

In Group B, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are designated as B1 and B2, respectively. If any of these teams fail to advance to the Super 4s, Afghanistan will take their place.

In June, the Asian Cricket Council had already unveiled the schedule of the hybrid model Asia Cup, with four matches being held in Pakistan and the remaining nine in Sri Lanka.

Given the strained political ties between India and Pakistan over the last decade and a half, bilateral cricket has suffered, leading the neighbouring countries to compete only in multi-team events at neutral venues. The Indian board expressed safety concerns and ruled out travelling to Pakistan for the Asia Cup in September, prompting the PCB to offer India the option of playing their matches in the United Arab Emirates, thus adopting the ‚Äúhybrid model.‚Äù

The participating teams in the tournament are India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and Nepal, making it a total of 13 ODI matches.

This year‚Äôs format features two groups of three teams each, with the top two from each group advancing to the Super Four stage. The top two teams from the Super Four will then compete in the final on September 17. Should India and Pakistan secure the top spots, they will meet for the third time ‚Äî the finals ‚Äî in the tournament in Colombo.

In the short term, the index is expected to stay positive. However, if it fails to surpass the 20,000 level, investors might engage in profit-taking.

Financials, FMCG & Healthcare stocks fired up Nifty, Sensex today

‚ÄúFinancials, FMCG & Healthcare fired up benchmark indices today which closed just shy of the magical 20k on the Nifty. FII‚Äôs have pulled off a 700-point rally in the Nifty since the 3rd of this month at the start of the earnings season for the first quarter,‚Äù said S Ranganathan, Head of Research at LKP securities.

Q1 results, FII inflow providing extra boost to Nifty, Sensex

‚ÄúUnlocking of value by heavyweights (like RIL & ITC) is apprising the main indices. The anticipation of good Q1 results from Banks, is providing an extra boost to drive to new highs. Mixed cues from global peers are not disturbing the mood of the domestic market as FIIs inflows stay put to the prospects of the Indian economy,‚Äù said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.

Investors might book profit if Nifty fails to surpass 20,000

‚ÄúNifty 50 remains above the critical moving average, indicating a positive trend. Furthermore, the RSI shows a bullish crossover, suggesting potential market strength. In the short term, the index is expected to stay positive. However, if it fails to surpass the 20,000 level, investors might engage in profit-taking. There is a support level of 19,800, which could attract buying interest during potential pullbacks,‚Äù said Rupak De, Senior Technical analyst at LKP Securities.

Bank Nifty support at 45500; resistance at 46400-46500

‚ÄúBank Nifty successfully surpassed the key resistance level of 46000, indicating a continuation of the upward momentum. The index is characterized by a series of ‚Äúhigher high and higher low formations,‚Äù which is a bullish pattern that confirms the strength of the uptrend. The support level for the index is at 45500, and as long as this level remains intact on a closing basis, the overall trend remains bullish. On the upside, the next immediate hurdle is placed at the 46400-46500 zone,‚Äù said Kunal Shah, Senior Technical & Derivative analyst at LKP Securities."

It is a subset of the Nifty 50 index, representing the top 50 companies listed on India's National Stock Exchange (NSE). The Nifty IT index comprises the top 10 IT companies listed on the NSE, based on their market capitalisation. These companies are among the largest IT services and software providers in India, and some of them are also global players in their respective domains.

The Nifty IT index is a market capitalization-weighted index, which means that the weightage of each company in the index is proportional to its market capitalization. This implies that the performance of larger companies has a greater impact on the index than smaller companies. The Nifty IT index is an important benchmark for investors interested in investing in the IT sector in India. It provides a broad view of the performance of the IT industry, which is a key sector of the Indian economy. The index is also a reference point for index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the IT sector in India.

The performance of the Nifty IT index is influenced by various factors, including the global trends in the IT industry, the demand for IT services and software, and the performance of individual companies. The index tends to be volatile, as it is sensitive to news and developments in the IT sector. For instance, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 had a significant impact on the IT industry, as many companies had to switch to remote work and adapt to new ways of working. As a result, the Nifty IT index experienced significant fluctuations during the pandemic.

It records the market performance of the Indian banks giving investors and market intermediaries a benchmark so they can evaluate properly before investing. The index constitutes a maximum of 12 companies listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and is computed through the free float market capitalization method. Investors or companies can use the Nifty Bank index for numerous purposes like benchmarking fund portfolios and launching index funds, ETFs and structured products. Though it was launched on September 15, 2003, Nifty Bank‚Äôs base value on the base date i.e, January 01, 2000, was set at 1000 and has given a CAGR of 24.61% in the first 10 years.

What are the eligibility criteria for the selection of constituent stocks under Nifty Bank?

At the time of review, companies should be a part of NIFTY 500. If the number of eligible stocks falls below 10, then according to NSE, the deficit number of stocks should be selected from the available stocks ranked within the top 800 based on daily average turnover and daily average full market capitalisation based on the data of previous six months which is used for index rebalancing of NIFTY 500. The company should be a part of the banking sector and its trading frequency needs to be at least 90% in the past six months. A listing history of six months is necessary for the company but if it comes out with an initial public offer (IPO) then it can be included in the index if it fulfils the eligibility criteria for three months instead of six. Only those companies can be a part of the index which are allowed to trade in the F&O segment. The final selection of all 12 companies is done based on the free-float market capitalization methodology by calculating the weightage of each company in the index in such a way that no stock weighs more than 33% and the top 3 stocks cumulatively should not be more than 62% during rebalancing. The index rebalancing is done on a semi-annual basis.

Who manages the Bank Nifty Index?

A professional team manages all the indices of NSE and follows a three-tier governance structure which includes the board of directors of NSE Indices Ltd, Index Advisory Committee (Equity) and the Index Maintenance Sub-Committee.

What is the Bank Nifty futures & options contract?

A forward contract trading on an exchange is called a futures contract. The Bank Nifty futures contracts are based on the Bank Nifty index. According to NSE, the maturity date of the contract, the underlying index and a market lot are some characteristics of the futures contract. These contracts are available for trading from the intro to the expiry date. Bank Nifty futures have a maximum of 3-month trading cycle - the near month (one), the next month (two) and the far month (three). A new contract is introduced on the trading day following the expiry of the near-month contract. The contracts expire on the last Thursday of the expiry month. If it is a trading holiday on the last Thursday, then contracts expire on the previous trading day."

The US stock market experienced a strong first half, with the Nasdaq Composite posting its best opening six months in four decades. The rally, driven by mega-cap technology shares, was driven by the excitement around AI software and central bank interest-rate hikes. The S&P 500 also surged 15.9% in H1 2023, with technology stocks driving most of the rally, while the DJIA fell behind.

In the second half, if history is any indication, stocks may benefit from their good start. According to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, the S&P 500 has increased by an average of 8% in the second half of the year since 1945, when it increased by at least 10% in the first half.

The US stock market‚Äôs bullish momentum in the first half could continue into the second half, as was seen in 1929 when the S&P 500 index climbed an average of 4.3% in the second half after rising at least 14% in the first six months. From October lows, the indices have rallied into the bull market, up by almost 20%. In October 2022, the market was trading at a 23% discount to a composite of Morningstar‚Äôs fundamental stock valuations, a level not seen since 2010.

Factors playing out in H2 are recession, interest rates, and the global economy. Although a recession is currently thought to be less likely to occur this year, economic worries still exist. A 71% risk of a recession in the coming 12 months was predicted by a New York Federal Reserve model of recession probability based on the Treasury yield curve earlier this month.

The second-largest economy in the world, China, announced second-quarter GDP growth of 6.3%, which was less than analysts had anticipated.

According to the International Monetary Fund, headline inflation appears to have peaked among the Group of 20 countries. Core inflation, however, continues to be significantly higher than the central banks‚Äô goal levels in the majority of G20 nations, especially the advanced economies.

Bull markets do not follow a straight line. Pullbacks, and possibly a correction, are to be expected in the second half. Since 1950, the average maximum downside for the S&P 500 during a calendar year has been minus 13.8%, which is significantly lower than this year‚Äôs current maximum drawdown of negative 7.8%.

Furthermore, historically, positive first-half S&P 500 gains have resulted in shorter second-half drawdowns. For example, the average second-half maximum drawdown after a positive first half is negative 9%, as opposed to an average drawdown of negative 13.1% when the first half was negative, according to data compiled by LPL Financial.

The technology industry has reached ‚Äúovervalued territory‚Äù in terms of valuation, and these megacap technology stocks ‚Äúhave already run their course.‚Äù Now is a good time to take a look at your portfolio and reallocate those assets that are overextended.

According to a theory put forth by Yale Hirsch of the Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac, the stock market exhibits a pattern that corresponds with a four-year presidential term. While typically the third year of a presidential cycle has seen the best performance of all four, the future for equities now appears even more promising."

The momentous event, much-awaited and steeped in rivalry, would culminate in a showdown ‚Äì India versus Pakistan ‚Äì on the grounds of Kandy, Sri Lanka, on September 2. As sworn adversaries, both teams found themselves positioned in Group A alongside Nepal, possibly entangling in a fierce match thrice within 15 days, provided they reach the Super 4 and ultimately, the finals.

The tournament‚Äôs commencement date is August 30, and it will run until September 17. This six-team ODI tournament serves as a precursor to the ICC World Cup and will kick off in Multan, with a Pakistan vs Nepal match.

After their opening match against their arch-rivals, led by Rohit Sharma, Team India will have a one-day break before facing Nepal on September 4 in Kandy. A brief interlude of one day would then lead them to another contest, this time against Nepal on September 4.

How India vs Pakistan may happen thrice

Asian Cricket Council (ACC) President Jay Shah confirmed that regardless of their positions after the first round, Pakistan will remain A1, and India will remain A2. In case either of them fails to qualify, Nepal will take their position. If both India and Pakistan manage to qualify, they are scheduled to face each other once more in Colombo on September 10.

In Group B, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are designated as B1 and B2, respectively. If any of these teams fail to advance to the Super 4s, Afghanistan will take their place.

In June, the Asian Cricket Council had already unveiled the schedule of the hybrid model Asia Cup, with four matches being held in Pakistan and the remaining nine in Sri Lanka.

Given the strained political ties between India and Pakistan over the last decade and a half, bilateral cricket has suffered, leading the neighbouring countries to compete only in multi-team events at neutral venues. The Indian board expressed safety concerns and ruled out travelling to Pakistan for the Asia Cup in September, prompting the PCB to offer India the option of playing their matches in the United Arab Emirates, thus adopting the ‚Äúhybrid model.‚Äù

The participating teams in the tournament are India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and Nepal, making it a total of 13 ODI matches.

This year‚Äôs format features two groups of three teams each, with the top two from each group advancing to the Super Four stage. The top two teams from the Super Four will then compete in the final on September 17. Should India and Pakistan secure the top spots, they will meet for the third time ‚Äî the finals ‚Äî in the tournament in Colombo.

The performance of the Nifty IT index is influenced by various factors, including the global trends in the IT industry, the demand for IT services and software, and the performance of individual companies.

Though it was launched on September 15, 2003, Nifty Bank‚Äôs base value on the base date i.e, January 01, 2000, was set at 1000 and has given a CAGR of 24.61% in the first 10 years.

What are the eligibility criteria for the selection of constituent stocks under Nifty Bank?

At the time of review, companies should be a part of NIFTY 500. If the number of eligible stocks falls below 10, then according to NSE, the deficit number of stocks should be selected from the available stocks ranked within the top 800 based on daily average turnover and daily average full market capitalisation based on the data of previous six months which is used for index rebalancing of NIFTY 500. The company should be a part of the banking sector and its trading frequency needs to be at least 90% in the past six months. A listing history of six months is necessary for the company but if it comes out with an initial public offer (IPO) then it can be included in the index if it fulfils the eligibility criteria for three months instead of six. Only those companies can be a part of the index which are allowed to trade in the F&O segment. The final selection of all 12 companies is done based on the free-float market capitalization methodology by calculating the weightage of each company in the index in such a way that no stock weighs more than 33% and the top 3 stocks cumulatively should not be more than 62% during rebalancing. The index rebalancing is done on a semi-annual basis.

Who manages the Bank Nifty Index?

A professional team manages all the indices of NSE and follows a three-tier governance structure which includes the board of directors of NSE Indices Ltd, Index Advisory Committee (Equity) and the Index Maintenance Sub-Committee.

What is the Bank Nifty futures & options contract?

A forward contract trading on an exchange is called a futures contract. The Bank Nifty futures contracts are based on the Bank Nifty index. According to NSE, the maturity date of the contract, the underlying index and a market lot are some characteristics of the futures contract. These contracts are available for trading from the intro to the expiry date. Bank Nifty futures have a maximum of 3-month trading cycle - the near month (one), the next month (two) and the far month (three). A new contract is introduced on the trading day following the expiry of the near-month contract. The contracts expire on the last Thursday of the expiry month. If it is a trading holiday on the last Thursday, then contracts expire on the previous trading day."

The US stock market experienced a strong first half, with the Nasdaq Composite posting its best opening six months in four decades. The rally, driven by mega-cap technology shares, was driven by the excitement around AI software and central bank interest-rate hikes. The S&P 500 also surged 15.9% in H1 2023, with technology stocks driving most of the rally, while the DJIA fell behind.

In the second half, if history is any indication, stocks may benefit from their good start. According to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, the S&P 500 has increased by an average of 8% in the second half of the year since 1945, when it increased by at least 10% in the first half.

The US stock market‚Äôs bullish momentum in the first half could continue into the second half, as was seen in 1929 when the S&P 500 index climbed an average of 4.3% in the second half after rising at least 14% in the first six months. From October lows, the indices have rallied into the bull market, up by almost 20%. In October 2022, the market was trading at a 23% discount to a composite of Morningstar‚Äôs fundamental stock valuations, a level not seen since 2010.

Factors playing out in H2 are recession, interest rates, and the global economy. Although a recession is currently thought to be less likely to occur this year, economic worries still exist. A 71% risk of a recession in the coming 12 months was predicted by a New York Federal Reserve model of recession probability based on the Treasury yield curve earlier this month.

The second-largest economy in the world, China, announced second-quarter GDP growth of 6.3%, which was less than analysts had anticipated.

According to the International Monetary Fund, headline inflation appears to have peaked among the Group of 20 countries. Core inflation, however, continues to be significantly higher than the central banks‚Äô goal levels in the majority of G20 nations, especially the advanced economies.

Bull markets do not follow a straight line. Pullbacks, and possibly a correction, are to be expected in the second half. Since 1950, the average maximum downside for the S&P 500 during a calendar year has been minus 13.8%, which is significantly lower than this year‚Äôs current maximum drawdown of negative 7.8%.

Furthermore, historically, positive first-half S&P 500 gains have resulted in shorter second-half drawdowns. For example, the average second-half maximum drawdown after a positive first half is negative 9%, as opposed to an average drawdown of negative 13.1% when the first half was negative, according to data compiled by LPL Financial.

The technology industry has reached ‚Äúovervalued territory‚Äù in terms of valuation, and these megacap technology stocks ‚Äúhave already run their course.‚Äù Now is a good time to take a look at your portfolio and reallocate those assets that are overextended.

According to a theory put forth by Yale Hirsch of the Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac, the stock market exhibits a pattern that corresponds with a four-year presidential term. While typically the third year of a presidential cycle has seen the best performance of all four, the future for equities now appears even more promising."

The momentous event, much-awaited and steeped in rivalry, would culminate in a showdown ‚Äì India versus Pakistan ‚Äì on the grounds of Kandy, Sri Lanka, on September 2. As sworn adversaries, both teams found themselves positioned in Group A alongside Nepal, possibly entangling in a fierce match thrice within 15 days, provided they reach the Super 4 and ultimately, the finals.

The tournament‚Äôs commencement date is August 30, and it will run until September 17. This six-team ODI tournament serves as a precursor to the ICC World Cup and will kick off in Multan, with a Pakistan vs Nepal match.

After their opening match against their arch-rivals, led by Rohit Sharma, Team India will have a one-day break before facing Nepal on September 4 in Kandy. A brief interlude of one day would then lead them to another contest, this time against Nepal on September 4.

How India vs Pakistan may happen thrice

Asian Cricket Council (ACC) President Jay Shah confirmed that regardless of their positions after the first round, Pakistan will remain A1, and India will remain A2. In case either of them fails to qualify, Nepal will take their position. If both India and Pakistan manage to qualify, they are scheduled to face each other once more in Colombo on September 10.

In Group B, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are designated as B1 and B2, respectively. If any of these teams fail to advance to the Super 4s, Afghanistan will take their place.

In June, the Asian Cricket Council had already unveiled the schedule of the hybrid model Asia Cup, with four matches being held in Pakistan and the remaining nine in Sri Lanka.

Given the strained political ties between India and Pakistan over the last decade and a half, bilateral cricket has suffered, leading the neighbouring countries to compete only in multi-team events at neutral venues. The Indian board expressed safety concerns and ruled out travelling to Pakistan for the Asia Cup in September, prompting the PCB to offer India the option of playing their matches in the United Arab Emirates, thus adopting the ‚Äúhybrid model.‚Äù

The participating teams in the tournament are India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and Nepal, making it a total of 13 ODI matches.

This year‚Äôs format features two groups of three teams each, with the top two from each group advancing to the Super Four stage. The top two teams from the Super Four will then compete in the final on September 17. Should India and Pakistan secure the top spots, they will meet for the third time ‚Äî the finals ‚Äî in the tournament in Colombo.

In the short term, the index is expected to stay positive. However, if it fails to surpass the 20,000 level, investors might engage in profit-taking.

Financials, FMCG & Healthcare stocks fired up Nifty, Sensex today

‚ÄúFinancials, FMCG & Healthcare fired up benchmark indices today which closed just shy of the magical 20k on the Nifty. FII‚Äôs have pulled off a 700-point rally in the Nifty since the 3rd of this month at the start of the earnings season for the first quarter,‚Äù said S Ranganathan, Head of Research at LKP securities.

Q1 results, FII inflow providing extra boost to Nifty, Sensex

‚ÄúUnlocking of value by heavyweights (like RIL & ITC) is apprising the main indices. The anticipation of good Q1 results from Banks, is providing an extra boost to drive to new highs. Mixed cues from global peers are not disturbing the mood of the domestic market as FIIs inflows stay put to the prospects of the Indian economy,‚Äù said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.

Investors might book profit if Nifty fails to surpass 20,000

‚ÄúNifty 50 remains above the critical moving average, indicating a positive trend. Furthermore, the RSI shows a bullish crossover, suggesting potential market strength. In the short term, the index is expected to stay positive. However, if it fails to surpass the 20,000 level, investors might engage in profit-taking. There is a support level of 19,800, which could attract buying interest during potential pullbacks,‚Äù said Rupak De, Senior Technical analyst at LKP Securities.

Bank Nifty support at 45500; resistance at 46400-46500

‚ÄúBank Nifty successfully surpassed the key resistance level of 46000, indicating a continuation of the upward momentum. The index is characterized by a series of ‚Äúhigher high and higher low formations,‚Äù which is a bullish pattern that confirms the strength of the uptrend. The support level for the index is at 45500, and as long as this level remains intact on a closing basis, the overall trend remains bullish. On the upside, the next immediate hurdle is placed at the 46400-46500 zone,‚Äù said Kunal Shah, Senior Technical & Derivative analyst at LKP Securities."

It is a subset of the Nifty 50 index, representing the top 50 companies listed on India's National Stock Exchange (NSE). The Nifty IT index comprises the top 10 IT companies listed on the NSE, based on their market capitalisation. These companies are among the largest IT services and software providers in India, and some of them are also global players in their respective domains.

The Nifty IT index is a market capitalization-weighted index, which means that the weightage of each company in the index is proportional to its market capitalization. This implies that the performance of larger companies has a greater impact on the index than smaller companies. The Nifty IT index is an important benchmark for investors interested in investing in the IT sector in India. It provides a broad view of the performance of the IT industry, which is a key sector of the Indian economy. The index is also a reference point for index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the IT sector in India.

The performance of the Nifty IT index is influenced by various factors, including the global trends in the IT industry, the demand for IT services and software, and the performance of individual companies. The index tends to be volatile, as it is sensitive to news and developments in the IT sector. For instance, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 had a significant impact on the IT industry, as many companies had to switch to remote work and adapt to new ways of working. As a result, the Nifty IT index experienced significant fluctuations during the pandemic.

It records the market performance of the Indian banks giving investors and market intermediaries a benchmark so they can evaluate properly before investing. The index constitutes a maximum of 12 companies listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and is computed through the free float market capitalization method. Investors or companies can use the Nifty Bank index for numerous purposes like benchmarking fund portfolios and launching index funds, ETFs and structured products. Though it was launched on September 15, 2003, Nifty Bank‚Äôs base value on the base date i.e, January 01, 2000, was set at 1000 and has given a CAGR of 24.61% in the first 10 years.

What are the eligibility criteria for the selection of constituent stocks under Nifty Bank?

At the time of review, companies should be a part of NIFTY 500. If the number of eligible stocks falls below 10, then according to NSE, the deficit number of stocks should be selected from the available stocks ranked within the top 800 based on daily average turnover and daily average full market capitalisation based on the data of previous six months which is used for index rebalancing of NIFTY 500. The company should be a part of the banking sector and its trading frequency needs to be at least 90% in the past six months. A listing history of six months is necessary for the company but if it comes out with an initial public offer (IPO) then it can be included in the index if it fulfils the eligibility criteria for three months instead of six. Only those companies can be a part of the index which are allowed to trade in the F&O segment. The final selection of all 12 companies is done based on the free-float market capitalization methodology by calculating the weightage of each company in the index in such a way that no stock weighs more than 33% and the top 3 stocks cumulatively should not be more than 62% during rebalancing. The index rebalancing is done on a semi-annual basis.

Who manages the Bank Nifty Index?

A professional team manages all the indices of NSE and follows a three-tier governance structure which includes the board of directors of NSE Indices Ltd, Index Advisory Committee (Equity) and the Index Maintenance Sub-Committee.

What is the Bank Nifty futures & options contract?

A forward contract trading on an exchange is called a futures contract. The Bank Nifty futures contracts are based on the Bank Nifty index. According to NSE, the maturity date of the contract, the underlying index and a market lot are some characteristics of the futures contract. These contracts are available for trading from the intro to the expiry date. Bank Nifty futures have a maximum of 3-month trading cycle - the near month (one), the next month (two) and the far month (three). A new contract is introduced on the trading day following the expiry of the near-month contract. The contracts expire on the last Thursday of the expiry month. If it is a trading holiday on the last Thursday, then contracts expire on the previous trading day."

The US stock market experienced a strong first half, with the Nasdaq Composite posting its best opening six months in four decades. The rally, driven by mega-cap technology shares, was driven by the excitement around AI software and central bank interest-rate hikes. The S&P 500 also surged 15.9% in H1 2023, with technology stocks driving most of the rally, while the DJIA fell behind.

In the second half, if history is any indication, stocks may benefit from their good start. According to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, the S&P 500 has increased by an average of 8% in the second half of the year since 1945, when it increased by at least 10% in the first half.

The US stock market‚Äôs bullish momentum in the first half could continue into the second half, as was seen in 1929 when the S&P 500 index climbed an average of 4.3% in the second half after rising at least 14% in the first six months. From October lows, the indices have rallied into the bull market, up by almost 20%. In October 2022, the market was trading at a 23% discount to a composite of Morningstar‚Äôs fundamental stock valuations, a level not seen since 2010.

Factors playing out in H2 are recession, interest rates, and the global economy. Although a recession is currently thought to be less likely to occur this year, economic worries still exist. A 71% risk of a recession in the coming 12 months was predicted by a New York Federal Reserve model of recession probability based on the Treasury yield curve earlier this month.

The second-largest economy in the world, China, announced second-quarter GDP growth of 6.3%, which was less than analysts had anticipated.

According to the International Monetary Fund, headline inflation appears to have peaked among the Group of 20 countries. Core inflation, however, continues to be significantly higher than the central banks‚Äô goal levels in the majority of G20 nations, especially the advanced economies.

Bull markets do not follow a straight line. Pullbacks, and possibly a correction, are to be expected in the second half. Since 1950, the average maximum downside for the S&P 500 during a calendar year has been minus 13.8%, which is significantly lower than this year‚Äôs current maximum drawdown of negative 7.8%.

Furthermore, historically, positive first-half S&P 500 gains have resulted in shorter second-half drawdowns. For example, the average second-half maximum drawdown after a positive first half is negative 9%, as opposed to an average drawdown of negative 13.1% when the first half was negative, according to data compiled by LPL Financial.

The technology industry has reached ‚Äúovervalued territory‚Äù in terms of valuation, and these megacap technology stocks ‚Äúhave already run their course.‚Äù Now is a good time to take a look at your portfolio and reallocate those assets that are overextended.

According to a theory put forth by Yale Hirsch of the Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac, the stock market exhibits a pattern that corresponds with a four-year presidential term. While typically the third year of a presidential cycle has seen the best performance of all four, the future for equities now appears even more promising."

The momentous event, much-awaited and steeped in rivalry, would culminate in a showdown ‚Äì India versus Pakistan ‚Äì on the grounds of Kandy, Sri Lanka, on September 2. As sworn adversaries, both teams found themselves positioned in Group A alongside Nepal, possibly entangling in a fierce match thrice within 15 days, provided they reach the Super 4 and ultimately, the finals.

The tournament‚Äôs commencement date is August 30, and it will run until September 17. This six-team ODI tournament serves as a precursor to the ICC World Cup and will kick off in Multan, with a Pakistan vs Nepal match.

After their opening match against their arch-rivals, led by Rohit Sharma, Team India will have a one-day break before facing Nepal on September 4 in Kandy. A brief interlude of one day would then lead them to another contest, this time against Nepal on September 4.

How India vs Pakistan may happen thrice

Asian Cricket Council (ACC) President Jay Shah confirmed that regardless of their positions after the first round, Pakistan will remain A1, and India will remain A2. In case either of them fails to qualify, Nepal will take their position. If both India and Pakistan manage to qualify, they are scheduled to face each other once more in Colombo on September 10.

In Group B, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are designated as B1 and B2, respectively. If any of these teams fail to advance to the Super 4s, Afghanistan will take their place.

In June, the Asian Cricket Council had already unveiled the schedule of the hybrid model Asia Cup, with four matches being held in Pakistan and the remaining nine in Sri Lanka.

Given the strained political ties between India and Pakistan over the last decade and a half, bilateral cricket has suffered, leading the neighbouring countries to compete only in multi-team events at neutral venues. The Indian board expressed safety concerns and ruled out travelling to Pakistan for the Asia Cup in September, prompting the PCB to offer India the option of playing their matches in the United Arab Emirates, thus adopting the ‚Äúhybrid model.‚Äù

The participating teams in the tournament are India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and Nepal, making it a total of 13 ODI matches.

This year‚Äôs format features two groups of three teams each, with the top two from each group advancing to the Super Four stage. The top two teams from the Super Four will then compete in the final on September 17. Should India and Pakistan secure the top spots, they will meet for the third time ‚Äî the finals ‚Äî in the tournament in Colombo.

The performance of the Nifty IT index is influenced by various factors, including the global trends in the IT industry, the demand for IT services and software, and the performance of individual companies.

Though it was launched on September 15, 2003, Nifty Bank‚Äôs base value on the base date i.e, January 01, 2000, was set at 1000 and has given a CAGR of 24.61% in the first 10 years.

What are the eligibility criteria for the selection of constituent stocks under Nifty Bank?

At the time of review, companies should be a part of NIFTY 500. If the number of eligible stocks falls below 10, then according to NSE, the deficit number of stocks should be selected from the available stocks ranked within the top 800 based on daily average turnover and daily average full market capitalisation based on the data of previous six months which is used for index rebalancing of NIFTY 500. The company should be a part of the banking sector and its trading frequency needs to be at least 90% in the past six months. A listing history of six months is necessary for the company but if it comes out with an initial public offer (IPO) then it can be included in the index if it fulfils the eligibility criteria for three months instead of six. Only those companies can be a part of the index which are allowed to trade in the F&O segment. The final selection of all 12 companies is done based on the free-float market capitalization methodology by calculating the weightage of each company in the index in such a way that no stock weighs more than 33% and the top 3 stocks cumulatively should not be more than 62% during rebalancing. The index rebalancing is done on a semi-annual basis.

Who manages the Bank Nifty Index?

A professional team manages all the indices of NSE and follows a three-tier governance structure which includes the board of directors of NSE Indices Ltd, Index Advisory Committee (Equity) and the Index Maintenance Sub-Committee.

What is the Bank Nifty futures & options contract?

A forward contract trading on an exchange is called a futures contract. The Bank Nifty futures contracts are based on the Bank Nifty index. According to NSE, the maturity date of the contract, the underlying index and a market lot are some characteristics of the futures contract. These contracts are available for trading from the intro to the expiry date. Bank Nifty futures have a maximum of 3-month trading cycle - the near month (one), the next month (two) and the far month (three). A new contract is introduced on the trading day following the expiry of the near-month contract. The contracts expire on the last Thursday of the expiry month. If it is a trading holiday on the last Thursday, then contracts expire on the previous trading day."

The US stock market experienced a strong first half, with the Nasdaq Composite posting its best opening six months in four decades. The rally, driven by mega-cap technology shares, was driven by the excitement around AI software and central bank interest-rate hikes. The S&P 500 also surged 15.9% in H1 2023, with technology stocks driving most of the rally, while the DJIA fell behind.

In the second half, if history is any indication, stocks may benefit from their good start. According to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, the S&P 500 has increased by an average of 8% in the second half of the year since 1945, when it increased by at least 10% in the first half.

The US stock market‚Äôs bullish momentum in the first half could continue into the second half, as was seen in 1929 when the S&P 500 index climbed an average of 4.3% in the second half after rising at least 14% in the first six months. From October lows, the indices have rallied into the bull market, up by almost 20%. In October 2022, the market was trading at a 23% discount to a composite of Morningstar‚Äôs fundamental stock valuations, a level not seen since 2010.

Factors playing out in H2 are recession, interest rates, and the global economy. Although a recession is currently thought to be less likely to occur this year, economic worries still exist. A 71% risk of a recession in the coming 12 months was predicted by a New York Federal Reserve model of recession probability based on the Treasury yield curve earlier this month.

The second-largest economy in the world, China, announced second-quarter GDP growth of 6.3%, which was less than analysts had anticipated.

According to the International Monetary Fund, headline inflation appears to have peaked among the Group of 20 countries. Core inflation, however, continues to be significantly higher than the central banks‚Äô goal levels in the majority of G20 nations, especially the advanced economies.

Bull markets do not follow a straight line. Pullbacks, and possibly a correction, are to be expected in the second half. Since 1950, the average maximum downside for the S&P 500 during a calendar year has been minus 13.8%, which is significantly lower than this year‚Äôs current maximum drawdown of negative 7.8%.

Furthermore, historically, positive first-half S&P 500 gains have resulted in shorter second-half drawdowns. For example, the average second-half maximum drawdown after a positive first half is negative 9%, as opposed to an average drawdown of negative 13.1% when the first half was negative, according to data compiled by LPL Financial.

The technology industry has reached ‚Äúovervalued territory‚Äù in terms of valuation, and these megacap technology stocks ‚Äúhave already run their course.‚Äù Now is a good time to take a look at your portfolio and reallocate those assets that are overextended.

According to a theory put forth by Yale Hirsch of the Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac, the stock market exhibits a pattern that corresponds with a four-year presidential term. While typically the third year of a presidential cycle has seen the best performance of all four, the future for equities now appears even more promising."

The momentous event, much-awaited and steeped in rivalry, would culminate in a showdown ‚Äì India versus Pakistan ‚Äì on the grounds of Kandy, Sri Lanka, on September 2. As sworn adversaries, both teams found themselves positioned in Group A alongside Nepal, possibly entangling in a fierce match thrice within 15 days, provided they reach the Super 4 and ultimately, the finals.

The tournament‚Äôs commencement date is August 30, and it will run until September 17. This six-team ODI tournament serves as a precursor to the ICC World Cup and will kick off in Multan, with a Pakistan vs Nepal match.

After their opening match against their arch-rivals, led by Rohit Sharma, Team India will have a one-day break before facing Nepal on September 4 in Kandy. A brief interlude of one day would then lead them to another contest, this time against Nepal on September 4.

How India vs Pakistan may happen thrice

Asian Cricket Council (ACC) President Jay Shah confirmed that regardless of their positions after the first round, Pakistan will remain A1, and India will remain A2. In case either of them fails to qualify, Nepal will take their position. If both India and Pakistan manage to qualify, they are scheduled to face each other once more in Colombo on September 10.

In Group B, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are designated as B1 and B2, respectively. If any of these teams fail to advance to the Super 4s, Afghanistan will take their place.

In June, the Asian Cricket Council had already unveiled the schedule of the hybrid model Asia Cup, with four matches being held in Pakistan and the remaining nine in Sri Lanka.

Given the strained political ties between India and Pakistan over the last decade and a half, bilateral cricket has suffered, leading the neighbouring countries to compete only in multi-team events at neutral venues. The Indian board expressed safety concerns and ruled out travelling to Pakistan for the Asia Cup in September, prompting the PCB to offer India the option of playing their matches in the United Arab Emirates, thus adopting the ‚Äúhybrid model.‚Äù

The participating teams in the tournament are India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and Nepal, making it a total of 13 ODI matches.

This year‚Äôs format features two groups of three teams each, with the top two from each group advancing to the Super Four stage. The top two teams from the Super Four will then compete in the final on September 17. Should India and Pakistan secure the top spots, they will meet for the third time ‚Äî the finals ‚Äî in the tournament in Colombo.

In the short term, the index is expected to stay positive. However, if it fails to surpass the 20,000 level, investors might engage in profit-taking.

Financials, FMCG & Healthcare stocks fired up Nifty, Sensex today

‚ÄúFinancials, FMCG & Healthcare fired up benchmark indices today which closed just shy of the magical 20k on the Nifty. FII‚Äôs have pulled off a 700-point rally in the Nifty since the 3rd of this month at the start of the earnings season for the first quarter,‚Äù said S Ranganathan, Head of Research at LKP securities.

Q1 results, FII inflow providing extra boost to Nifty, Sensex

‚ÄúUnlocking of value by heavyweights (like RIL & ITC) is apprising the main indices. The anticipation of good Q1 results from Banks, is providing an extra boost to drive to new highs. Mixed cues from global peers are not disturbing the mood of the domestic market as FIIs inflows stay put to the prospects of the Indian economy,‚Äù said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.

Investors might book profit if Nifty fails to surpass 20,000

‚ÄúNifty 50 remains above the critical moving average, indicating a positive trend. Furthermore, the RSI shows a bullish crossover, suggesting potential market strength. In the short term, the index is expected to stay positive. However, if it fails to surpass the 20,000 level, investors might engage in profit-taking. There is a support level of 19,800, which could attract buying interest during potential pullbacks,‚Äù said Rupak De, Senior Technical analyst at LKP Securities.

Bank Nifty support at 45500; resistance at 46400-46500

‚ÄúBank Nifty successfully surpassed the key resistance level of 46000, indicating a continuation of the upward momentum. The index is characterized by a series of ‚Äúhigher high and higher low formations,‚Äù which is a bullish pattern that confirms the strength of the uptrend. The support level for the index is at 45500, and as long as this level remains intact on a closing basis, the overall trend remains bullish. On the upside, the next immediate hurdle is placed at the 46400-46500 zone,‚Äù said Kunal Shah, Senior Technical & Derivative analyst at LKP Securities."

It is a subset of the Nifty 50 index, representing the top 50 companies listed on India's National Stock Exchange (NSE). The Nifty IT index comprises the top 10 IT companies listed on the NSE, based on their market capitalisation. These companies are among the largest IT services and software providers in India, and some of them are also global players in their respective domains.

The Nifty IT index is a market capitalization-weighted index, which means that the weightage of each company in the index is proportional to its market capitalization. This implies that the performance of larger companies has a greater impact on the index than smaller companies. The Nifty IT index is an important benchmark for investors interested in investing in the IT sector in India. It provides a broad view of the performance of the IT industry, which is a key sector of the Indian economy. The index is also a reference point for index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the IT sector in India.

The performance of the Nifty IT index is influenced by various factors, including the global trends in the IT industry, the demand for IT services and software, and the performance of individual companies. The index tends to be volatile, as it is sensitive to news and developments in the IT sector. For instance, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 had a significant impact on the IT industry, as many companies had to switch to remote work and adapt to new ways of working. As a result, the Nifty IT index experienced significant fluctuations during the pandemic.

It records the market performance of the Indian banks giving investors and market intermediaries a benchmark so they can evaluate properly before investing. The index constitutes a maximum of 12 companies listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and is computed through the free float market capitalization method. Investors or companies can use the Nifty Bank index for numerous purposes like benchmarking fund portfolios and launching index funds, ETFs and structured products. Though it was launched on September 15, 2003, Nifty Bank‚Äôs base value on the base date i.e, January 01, 2000, was set at 1000 and has given a CAGR of 24.61% in the first 10 years.

What are the eligibility criteria for the selection of constituent stocks under Nifty Bank?

At the time of review, companies should be a part of NIFTY 500. If the number of eligible stocks falls below 10, then according to NSE, the deficit number of stocks should be selected from the available stocks ranked within the top 800 based on daily average turnover and daily average full market capitalisation based on the data of previous six months which is used for index rebalancing of NIFTY 500. The company should be a part of the banking sector and its trading frequency needs to be at least 90% in the past six months. A listing history of six months is necessary for the company but if it comes out with an initial public offer (IPO) then it can be included in the index if it fulfils the eligibility criteria for three months instead of six. Only those companies can be a part of the index which are allowed to trade in the F&O segment. The final selection of all 12 companies is done based on the free-float market capitalization methodology by calculating the weightage of each company in the index in such a way that no stock weighs more than 33% and the top 3 stocks cumulatively should not be more than 62% during rebalancing. The index rebalancing is done on a semi-annual basis.

Who manages the Bank Nifty Index?

A professional team manages all the indices of NSE and follows a three-tier governance structure which includes the board of directors of NSE Indices Ltd, Index Advisory Committee (Equity) and the Index Maintenance Sub-Committee.

What is the Bank Nifty futures & options contract?

A forward contract trading on an exchange is called a futures contract. The Bank Nifty futures contracts are based on the Bank Nifty index. According to NSE, the maturity date of the contract, the underlying index and a market lot are some characteristics of the futures contract. These contracts are available for trading from the intro to the expiry date. Bank Nifty futures have a maximum of 3-month trading cycle - the near month (one), the next month (two) and the far month (three). A new contract is introduced on the trading day following the expiry of the near-month contract. The contracts expire on the last Thursday of the expiry month. If it is a trading holiday on the last Thursday, then contracts expire on the previous trading day."

The US stock market experienced a strong first half, with the Nasdaq Composite posting its best opening six months in four decades. The rally, driven by mega-cap technology shares, was driven by the excitement around AI software and central bank interest-rate hikes. The S&P 500 also surged 15.9% in H1 2023, with technology stocks driving most of the rally, while the DJIA fell behind.

In the second half, if history is any indication, stocks may benefit from their good start. According to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, the S&P 500 has increased by an average of 8% in the second half of the year since 1945, when it increased by at least 10% in the first half.

The US stock market‚Äôs bullish momentum in the first half could continue into the second half, as was seen in 1929 when the S&P 500 index climbed an average of 4.3% in the second half after rising at least 14% in the first six months. From October lows, the indices have rallied into the bull market, up by almost 20%. In October 2022, the market was trading at a 23% discount to a composite of Morningstar‚Äôs fundamental stock valuations, a level not seen since 2010.

Factors playing out in H2 are recession, interest rates, and the global economy. Although a recession is currently thought to be less likely to occur this year, economic worries still exist. A 71% risk of a recession in the coming 12 months was predicted by a New York Federal Reserve model of recession probability based on the Treasury yield curve earlier this month.

The second-largest economy in the world, China, announced second-quarter GDP growth of 6.3%, which was less than analysts had anticipated.

According to the International Monetary Fund, headline inflation appears to have peaked among the Group of 20 countries. Core inflation, however, continues to be significantly higher than the central banks‚Äô goal levels in the majority of G20 nations, especially the advanced economies.

Bull markets do not follow a straight line. Pullbacks, and possibly a correction, are to be expected in the second half. Since 1950, the average maximum downside for the S&P 500 during a calendar year has been minus 13.8%, which is significantly lower than this year‚Äôs current maximum drawdown of negative 7.8%.

Furthermore, historically, positive first-half S&P 500 gains have resulted in shorter second-half drawdowns. For example, the average second-half maximum drawdown after a positive first half is negative 9%, as opposed to an average drawdown of negative 13.1% when the first half was negative, according to data compiled by LPL Financial.

The technology industry has reached ‚Äúovervalued territory‚Äù in terms of valuation, and these megacap technology stocks ‚Äúhave already run their course.‚Äù Now is a good time to take a look at your portfolio and reallocate those assets that are overextended.

According to a theory put forth by Yale Hirsch of the Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac, the stock market exhibits a pattern that corresponds with a four-year presidential term. While typically the third year of a presidential cycle has seen the best performance of all four, the future for equities now appears even more promising."

The momentous event, much-awaited and steeped in rivalry, would culminate in a showdown ‚Äì India versus Pakistan ‚Äì on the grounds of Kandy, Sri Lanka, on September 2. As sworn adversaries, both teams found themselves positioned in Group A alongside Nepal, possibly entangling in a fierce match thrice within 15 days, provided they reach the Super 4 and ultimately, the finals.

The tournament‚Äôs commencement date is August 30, and it will run until September 17. This six-team ODI tournament serves as a precursor to the ICC World Cup and will kick off in Multan, with a Pakistan vs Nepal match.

After their opening match against their arch-rivals, led by Rohit Sharma, Team India will have a one-day break before facing Nepal on September 4 in Kandy. A brief interlude of one day would then lead them to another contest, this time against Nepal on September 4.

How India vs Pakistan may happen thrice

Asian Cricket Council (ACC) President Jay Shah confirmed that regardless of their positions after the first round, Pakistan will remain A1, and India will remain A2. In case either of them fails to qualify, Nepal will take their position. If both India and Pakistan manage to qualify, they are scheduled to face each other once more in Colombo on September 10.

In Group B, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are designated as B1 and B2, respectively. If any of these teams fail to advance to the Super 4s, Afghanistan will take their place.

In June, the Asian Cricket Council had already unveiled the schedule of the hybrid model Asia Cup, with four matches being held in Pakistan and the remaining nine in Sri Lanka.

Given the strained political ties between India and Pakistan over the last decade and a half, bilateral cricket has suffered, leading the neighbouring countries to compete only in multi-team events at neutral venues. The Indian board expressed safety concerns and ruled out travelling to Pakistan for the Asia Cup in September, prompting the PCB to offer India the option of playing their matches in the United Arab Emirates, thus adopting the ‚Äúhybrid model.‚Äù

The participating teams in the tournament are India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and Nepal, making it a total of 13 ODI matches.

This year‚Äôs format features two groups of three teams each, with the top two from each group advancing to the Super Four stage. The top two teams from the Super Four will then compete in the final on September 17. Should India and Pakistan secure the top spots, they will meet for the third time ‚Äî the finals ‚Äî in the tournament in Colombo.

The performance of the Nifty IT index is influenced by various factors, including the global trends in the IT industry, the demand for IT services and software, and the performance of individual companies.

What are the eligibility criteria for the selection of constituent stocks under Nifty Bank?

At the time of review, companies should be a part of NIFTY 500. If the number of eligible stocks falls below 10, then according to NSE, the deficit number of stocks should be selected from the available stocks ranked within the top 800 based on daily average turnover and daily average full market capitalisation based on the data of previous six months which is used for index rebalancing of NIFTY 500. The company should be a part of the banking sector and its trading frequency needs to be at least 90% in the past six months. A listing history of six months is necessary for the company but if it comes out with an initial public offer (IPO) then it can be included in the index if it fulfils the eligibility criteria for three months instead of six. Only those companies can be a part of the index which are allowed to trade in the F&O segment. The final selection of all 12 companies is done based on the free-float market capitalization methodology by calculating the weightage of each company in the index in such a way that no stock weighs more than 33% and the top 3 stocks cumulatively should not be more than 62% during rebalancing. The index rebalancing is done on a semi-annual basis.
